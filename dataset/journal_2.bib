abstract = {The efficient removal of carbon monoxide (CO) from H2-rich stream via the water gas shift (WGS) reaction requires the catalysts that possess high activity at low temperatures to avoid the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation. We report that oxygen (O2) plasma activation enables an Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst to achieve superior activity in the WGS reaction at low temperatures. At 120 °C, O2 plasma activated Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst exhibits CO reaction rate of 0.51 mmol·mg−1·h−1, which is 5 times higher than the conventional activated counterpart. CO conversion over O2 plasma activated Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst only slightly decreases from 73% to 68% during a 4.5 h continuous WGS reaction at 150 °C. The catalyst characterizations indicate that O2 plasma activation could control average size of Au nanoparticles below 3.5 nm, create plenty of coordinatively unsaturated sites (on Au nanoparticles) and sufficient Auδ+-Oδ--Ti sites (at interfaces between Au and TiO2), and modulate the electronic structure of interfaces, which accelerates greatly the WGS reaction. Further, the enhancement mechanism of the WGS reaction over O2 plasma activated Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst was disclosed.}

abstract = {Polymer-based dielectrics trigger great interests in advanced electric systems due to their high breakdown strength and power density. However, a major drawback is that excessive addition of high-εr ceramic nanofillers may deteriorate their breakdown strength and further reduce energy density. Herein, a general strategy is provided to dramatically enhance the breakdown strength by introducing a small amount of core–shell structured Al2O3@BiFeO3 nanofibers into PVDF/PMMA polymer matrix. The thickness of BiFeO3 shell is regulated by controlling its molar concentration. A significantly enhanced breakdown strength (759 kV mm−1) and an ultrahigh energy density (22.7 J cm−3) with an energy efficiency of 72% are observed. The greatly improved breakdown strength is ascribed to the regulation of electron depletion layer. When the width of heterojunction region gradually approaches to the scale of electron depletion layer, more annihilation of electrons happens and thus contributes to the enhancement of the breakdown strength. The results suggest that our designed structure can help to address the issue of both enhancing the breakdown strength and energy density for diverse nanocomposites over a broad application.}

Herein, an environment-friendly and original nanofibrous aerogel with integrative performance was constructed through the combination of nanofibrous aerogels’ forming technique and post-treatment modification approach. The obtained aerogel has a hierarchical porous structure consisting of flexible polyacrylonitrile nanofibers (PANF), a functional polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polymer, conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and hydrophobic octadecylamine functionalized reduced graphene oxide (ODA-rGO), endowing it with ultralow density (20.54 mg cm−3), superior compressibility and recoverability, outstanding fatigue resistance over 1000 cycles. The hydrophobic ODA-rGO coating imparts the hydrophilic PANF/CNT aerogel superhydrophobicity (154°), contributing to a splendid self-cleaning ability. Additionally, the aerogel was capable of realizing excellent oil/water separation performances. Both organic solvents and soybean oil could be adsorbed by the aerogel with high adsorption capacity (36.07 to 65.09 g g−1) and good stable in recycling as a result of its hierarchical porous structure and good hydrophobicity. It was noteworthy that the aerogel composite can be used as a piezoresistive sensor, exhibiting high sensitivity (33 kPa−1 in the range of 0–2 kPa), low detection limit (1% strain), fast response (160 ms), and good durability (over 1000 cycles). Further, it was demonstrated that the composite can be used to monitor various human activities in real time. These advantages make it an excellent candidate for smart garments, high-efficient oil/water separation and human motion detection.}

abstract = {Li-O2 battery is one of the most attractive energy storage technologies because of its extremely high energy density (3500 Wh kg−1). However, the main limitation of the battery is the high energy barrier during the formation and decomposition of the discharge product (Li2O2), which results in a series of problems such as large overpotential and poor cycle stability. Herein, the Fe-doped spinel Ni-Co oxides are employed as the cathode catalyst to decrease the energy barrier of the oxygen electrode reactions in Li-O2 battery. The batteries with Fe-doped Ni-Co oxides deliver a large discharge specific capacity of 16,727 mAh g−1 and remarkable durability of over 790 h at current density of 500 mA g−1. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the optimized performance is attributed to the near-unity eg electron occupancy (1.32) in transition metal atom for iron-doped Ni-Co oxide as compared to that for undoped Ni-Co oxide (1.64). The near-unity eg electron occupancy can increase the covalency of transition metal-oxygen bonds and finally enhance the electrocatalytic activity. This study is helpful for deeply understanding the relationship between the surface electronic structure and catalytic activity of oxygen electrocatalysts in Li-O2 cells.}

Herein, inspired by the typical morphology and formation of pruney fingers, we develop a novel core–shell “pruney fiber” with both isotropic wrinkles and robust interfaces via a scalable and facile fabrication strategy. Briefly, the robust isotropic wrinkles are constructed through the core thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) molecular chain’s constriction and the sheath pyrrole monomer’ synergistic interfacial polymerization. As a result, the robust interfaces enable the pruney fiber high stabilities under a remark stretchability (200%). Two as-prepared pruney fibers are overlapped vertically for piezoresistive sensing. Owe to the interlocking of the surface isotropic wrinkles, the piezoresistive fibers show high sensitivity (0.15 kPa−1), fast response time (47 ms), low detection limit (0.2 g), and high stability. For practical applications, the piezoresistive fibers can be easily weaved and integrated into a smart glove for wearable sensors and human–machine interfaces (HMI). At last, the novel structure and its unique scalable developing process would pave a new way in stable surface structure engineering on variable surface in the future.}

Herein, silver (Ag) micro-tubes with superstructure, which were fabricated via using poly(lactic acid) (PLA) fibers as templates, were used to achieve the composites with ultrahigh, lightweight, and absorption-dominant electromagnetic shielding performance. The Ag nanoparticles were firstly deposited on the surface of PLA fibers by chemical reduction. The Ag micro-tubes were obtained by etching the PLA fibers in the core. The Ag nanoparticles were stuck together to form the Ag micro-tubes by polymer chains. The ultrahigh electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE) of ∼110 dB was found in the Ag micro-tubes composed with polydimethylsiloxane or PLA with 1.5 mm in thickness. Due to the micro-tube structure, the composites containing with Ag micro-tubes exhibited absorption dominant shielding mechanism and low density. The absorption coefficient (A) value could reach 0.79 in the composites with Ag micro-tubes. The ultrahigh EMI SE performance and absorption dominant shielding mechanism of the composites was ascribed to the superstructure of the Ag micro-tubes which could efficiently create surface plasmon resonance, electronic vibration, interfacial polarization, capacitance effect and conductive loss. The work provides a new idea for preparing ultrahigh electromagnetic shielding materials with high absorption and low density.}

Herein, a novel anti-wetting and anti-fouling multifunctional Janus membrane was designed by optimization of the size of reentrant structure and position of hydrophilic layer. The theoretical relationships between wettability and the microstructure of the Janus membrane was derived mathematically. A facile approach was applied for the dual-layer bioinspired membrane fabrication by a two-step electrospray strategy. The resultant composite structure presented high omniphobicity (water contact angle of omniphobic sub-surface was 159.3 ± 1.1°) and underwater superoleophobicity (underwater oil contact angle of hydrophilic top surface was 152.7 ± 0.5°). Meanwhile, the wettability of the fabricated Janus membrane kept robust in a broad pH range of 1–14. During continuous MD treatment for emulsified oily hypersaline solution, the Janus membrane exhibited stable permeate flux and salt rejection (around 100%). It was speculated that the hydration effect of hydrophilic top layer coupled with the cavitation and slip boundary effects of the reentrant structure might be the key reasons for the robust anti-wetting and anti-fouling performances. Significantly, this novel bioinspired Janus membrane was believed as a candidate for treating challenging wastewaters such as the shale oils produced-water, and also had high potential in paving the way for industrial application of MD.}

Exploring new electrocatalyst with strong catalytic ability can greatly accelerate the conversion of polysulfides in Li-S batteries. Herein, BiOI/carbon fibers (BiOI/CFs) core–shell composite has been prepared by a facile electrospinning combined with solvothermal method and used as a promising electrocatalyst. The BiOI nanosheets are cross-linked to form a porous three-dimensional network on the surface of carbon fibers. This architecture not only has the advantage of large aspect ratio, but also has a high specific surface area, which provides abundant active sites and ensures high electron/ion transfer for the electrocatalysis of lithium polysulfides. As expected, BiOI/CFs electrode presents a superior bidirectional oxidation–reduction ability for polysulfides. The first-principles calculations also prove the strong interaction between BiOI and polysulfides. Due to these advantages, BiOI/CFs can effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides, and possesses excellent electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries. The specific capacity of the BiOI/CFs-S electrode is stable at 1020 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.2C and 598 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5C.

The surface morphology analysis revealed the edge-capped ZrO2 nanoparticles on the V2O5 nanowires. The optical analysis showed that the heterostructure formation between ZrO2 and V2O5 could tune the bandgap (2.05 eV) of the composite. Due to the improved separation efficacy of the photoexcited charge carriers and greater surface area, compared to the pure materials, the ZrO2/V2O5 (ZV) composite displayed considerable improvement in photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction performance, as well as excellent reusability performance (70.5 % after 4 cycles), thus facilitating its wastewater treatment. The ZV electrode displayed approximately 1.6- and 5.8-fold improvement in specific capacitance over the ZrO2 and V2O5 electrodes, respectively. Furthermore, the ZV electrode exhibited the lowest charge resistance under light illumination conditions. From the linear sweep voltammetry curve analysis, the ZV electrode possessed an improved photocurrent density (5.363 mA cm−2), demonstrating approximately 33- and 3.5-times improvement in photocurrent density over the pristine electrodes.}

Herein, an effective metal-organic framework adsorbent, MOF-808-SH, was fabricated by grafting thioglycollic acid on MOF-808 for Hg(II) removal. The MOF-808-SH demonstrated high adsorption capacity of 977.5 mg/g, impressively ultrafast adsorption kinetics (C0 = 10 mg/L, removal > 99 % in 10 s) with a rate constant k of 36.89 g mg−1 min−1, which is dozens of times faster than that of ever reported Hg(II) adsorbents. Batch experiments show that MOF-808-SH exhibits high selectivity toward Hg(II) with a distribution coefficient Kd as high as 5.0×106 mL/g. Moreover, MOF-808-SH exhibits excellent recyclability with a negligible loss of capacity after 6 adsorption-regeneration cycles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) unveil that the –SH groups in MOF-808-SH are the key adsorption sites, and specific inner-sphere coordination with Hg(II) is responsible for the high selectivity. In addition, large surface area, well-developed porous structures and high –SH loading of MOF-808-SH reasonably explains ultrafast kinetics and high adsorption capacity for Hg(II). This study indicates the potential of MOF-808-SH to remove Hg(II) from wastewater.}

In this study, a directional built-in electric field was established in FeOCl-CuO for the first time that can synergistically transfer free radical and nonfree radical electrons. The directional built-in electric field provides electron transfer channels, CuO oxidizes peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to produce 1O2 and gains electrons, electrons are transferred to FeOCl through the directional built-in electric field, and FeOCl catalyzes PMS to produce ·OH and SO4·- and loses electrons. Thus, reactive oxygen species are rapidly produced, and toxic organic pollutants are synergistically oxidatively degraded. This directional built-in electric field-mediated radical/nonradical synergistic mechanism can achieve electron synergy and overcome the electron gain/loss limitation of radical or nonradical reactions, which results in an efficient, sustained and stable catalytic degradation of toxic organic pollutants (kinetic reaction rate constant is increased 38.3 times). Pollutants could be stably removed in pilot devices. The developed kinetic model successfully predicted the kinetic reaction rate constants under different conditions. Theoretical calculations and toxicity assessment revealed that this synergistic radical/nonradical oxidation pathway can effectively degrade bisphenol A (BPA) into less toxic or harmless small molecules and capture carbon in an alkaline environment to reduce carbon emissions. This study provides new insights into the efficient, sustained, and low-carbon treatment of toxic organic wastewater by synergistic radical/nonradical oxidation in complex aqueous environments.}

abstract = {All-solid-state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are key for improving lithium-ion battery (LIB) safety and the practical application of metallic Li anodes. The major challenges of developing SPEs are their ionic conductivity, interfacial affinity, and flammability. In this article, synthesis of an SPE comprising lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and poly(ethylene oxide) networked with an acylamino-functionalized crosslinker is reported. The acylamino sites, urethane and biuret linkages, dissociate LiTFSI and may form deep-eutectic-solvent domains to facilitate ion transport. This SPE is fire-retarding because CO2 evolves when the urethane decomposes at high temperatures. When operated at room temperature, the all-solid-state Li|SPE|LiFePO4 cell exhibits a high rate capability and long lifespan. Due to the high elasticity of the SPE, the polymers can self-rearrange during operation to reduce the Li–SPE interfacial resistance and regulate Li+-ion transport for uniform Li deposition. The rearrangement may involve migration of the low-energy alkane chains in the crosslinker toward the Li-anode, resulting in overspreading of lithiophilic carbonyl groups and F-atoms of TFSI− at the interface. This rearrangement property enables the SPE to act as an artificial interlayer in liquid-electrolyte LIBs. The advantages of using an acylamino-functionalized crosslinker to synthesize a networked SPE for high ionic conductivity and interfacial compatibility are demonstrated.}

abstract = {Low-carbon stabilization/solidification (S/S) is of increasing importance for sustainable treatment of hazardous wastes. In this study, we integrated carbon-negative rice husk biochar (RBC) and yard waste biochar (YBC) as green additives into the binder for S/S of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash. Experimental results illustrated that the addition of both biochars promoted cement hydration reaction via pozzolanic reaction and internal curing. In particular, the incorporation of 10 wt% RBC (rich in activated Si) significantly increased the content of C-S-H gel from 41.6 wt% (control sample) to 52.0 wt% and increased the average degree of connectivity of C-S-H gel from 1.43 to 1.52 as indicated by quantitative X-ray diffraction and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. The incorporation of RBC and YBC (20 or 30 wt%) enhanced the immobilization efficiency of potentially toxic elements in MSWI fly ash due to the additional hydration products and high adsorption ability of biochar. For instance, in R-80FA and Y-80FA samples (namely, 20 wt% binder dosage, of which RBC or YBC accounted for 10 wt% of binder), the immobilization efficiency for Pb could reach 96.2% and comply with the leachability limit. The biochar-modified S/S blocks achieved comparable strength to the cement-based S/S blocks, presenting a mechanically stable solidified matrix for engineering application. Therefore, this study expands the emerging application of biochar and demonstrates that biochar-augmented binder can ensure low-carbon and high-performance S/S of hazardous materials.}

Herein, a well-designed multiheterostructure of SnS@C@MoS2@NC micronflower is successfully synthesized, which consists of SnS, intermediate carbon, MoS2 and N-doped carbon from interior to exterior. The Schottky junction with built-in electric-field induced by phase boundaries and the double carbon layers (intermediate carbon and N-doped carbon coating layer) significantly improve the electrons transfer rate, and simultaneously the multiheterostructure affords rapid K+ diffusion, strong K absorption and boosted electronic conductivity, resulting in superior charge transfer kinetics, which is explicitly unraveled by experimental results and first-principles calculations. Moreover, this multilayered structure with double carbon layers can effectively buffer the volumetric variation and maintain structural stability. Benefiting from these merits, the SnS@C@MoS2@NC anode delivers remarkable reversible capacity (471 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 100 cycles), outstanding rate performance (305 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1) and ultralong lifespan (253 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 after 3000 cycles) for KIBs.

In the present study, the kinetic mechanism of electrochemical promotion of CO2 hydrogenation was investigated using a scaled up, monolithic electropromoted reactor (MEPR) loaded with nine parallelly connected Ru/YSZ/Au electrochemical cells. The study was carried out under atmospheric pressure, at 370 °C, with a flowrate of 1000 cm3/min and over a wide range of reactants partial pressures. The morphological and electronic characteristics of the catalyst surface, before and after reaction, were thoroughly investigated with a variety of techniques including X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). It was shown that increasing the partial pressure of H2 (electron donor) leads to an increase in the methane production rate with a concurrent decrease of CO formation. Methanation emerges with a positive order in H2 whereas the RWGS with a negative one. Increasing the partial pressure of electron acceptor (CO2) leads to the opposite behavior. Based on the kinetic results and the rules of chemical and electrochemical promotion, an electrophobic behavior (increase of the rate with increasing catalyst potential) is expected for the methanation reaction and an electrophilic (decrease of the rate with increasing catalyst potential) for the RWGS reaction. Both predictions are confirmed experimentally. The results are in agreement with previous studies on CO2 hydrogenation in laboratory scale reactors demonstrating the successful design and operation of the current scaled up electropromoted system (MEPR).}

Herein, different from common hierarchical porosity designs, a positive charge-assisted Janus hydrogel evaporator with enhanced Donnan exclusion toward ammonium is uniquely achieved without sacrificing the water evaporation capability. The ammonium diffusion resistance of the so-fabricated Janus evaporator is significantly increased by optimizing the charge density and diffusion distance, yielding a high ammonium rejection rate up to 95%, which is never reported before. Meanwhile, the Janus evaporator also yields a water evaporation rate up to 3.3 kg m−2h−1 for the natural wastewater via partial amorphization of cellulose Iα allomorph, which is ∼3 times faster than the previous photothermal materials for intercepting volatile phenol molecules. This work points out new avenues for the application of photothermal materials in separating freshwater from small volatile molecules using clean solar energy.}

Due to the lack of data about GC removal using advanced treatment processes, a novel Paralleling and bubbling corona discharge reactor (PBCD) combined with iron-loaded activated-carbon fibre (Fe-ACF) was addressed in this study to degrade GCs represented by Hydrocortisone (HC) and Betamethasone (BT). The results showed that the PBCD-based system can degrade GCs effectively and can achieve effective sterilization. The removal rates of GCs were ranked as PBCD/Fe-ACF > PBCD/ACF > PBCD. The concentration of E. coli was reduced from 109 to 102 CFU/mL after 60 min of PBCD-based system treatment. The abundance of bacteria in actual Hospital wastewater (HWW) was significantly reduced. Plasma changed the physical and chemical properties of ACF and Fe-ACF by etching axial grooves and enhancing stretching vibrations of surface functional groups, thus promoting adsorption and catalytic degradation. For GC degradation, the functional reactive species were identified as •OH, 1O2, and •O2 radicals. Possible degradation pathways for HC and BT were proposed, which mainly included defluorination, keto acid decarboxylation, demethylation, intramolecular cyclization, cleavage and ester hydrolysis, indicating a reduction in GC toxicity. Since GCs are widely used in patients with COVID-19 and their wastewater needs to be sterilized simultaneously, the intensive and electrically driven PBCD-based system is promising in GC pollution control and sterilization in terminal water treatment facilities.}

Furthermore, the compatibility of anode interface has been tremendously enhanced by the interface engineering of fluorine-rich gel protective layer on Li anode (Gel-Li) via in-situ polymerization, which can effectively prevent the lithium dendrite growth and endow outstanding long-term cyclic stability of the Li symmetric battery. As a result, the assembled MWCNT@S/Gel-Li and LiNbO3@LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2/Gel-Li batteries based on such electrolyte film display desirable discharge specific capacities and outstanding cycling stability at ambient-temperature.

Mechanism study shows that MnO2 is deposited on the cathode during charging, H+/Zn2+ insertion and disproportionation occur sequentially during discharging, leading to Mn2+ dissolution. The generated high-valence manganese oxides via disproportionation further experience reduction-disproportionation-dissolution, which proceeds repeatedly in the expanded discharge potential to 0 V vs. Zn2+/Zn, resulting in the complete dissolution of the cathodic materials. Our results provide the fundamental understanding on the controversial mechanisms of Zn-MnO2 batteries with mild aqueous electrolytes and highlight the effect of disproportionation in pushing the electrochemical performance of the promising Zn-MnO2 hybrid batteries.}

The kinetics and mechanistic pathways for sulfite photooxidation are examined, while process feasibility and environmental relevance are evaluated by process simulation and life cycle assessment. Results show that increasing the initial sulfite concentration results in faster reaction rates, following first-order kinetics with an activation energy of 32.9 kJ/mol. Moreover, kinetics is ascribed to two competing photoinduced radical-mediated reaction pathways. Finally, powering the process by renewable energy leads to positive human health, ecosystems, and resources scores in life cycle assessment, supporting the sustainability of the process.

Carboxyl-modified CC scaffold regulates attractive interaction between ZIF and PEG, which enhances energy storage capacity of the phase change composite.

Contrasting effects of MP aging on SA adsorption were observed. That is, the adsorption capacities of aged PAs were decreased from 14.45% to 58.53%, whereas those of aged TPUs were increased from 13.93% to 171.30%. To interpret this interesting phenomenon, the structural characteristics of the tested MPs were determined, and the results indicated that the surface structures of MPs changed with aging, which resulted in differences in hydrophobicity and surface charge and a significant difference in the concentrations of oxygen-containing functional groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) results revealed that the equilibrium configurations and the interactions (H bond, electrostatic effect, van der Waals (vdW) forces were significantly influenced by the change in the concentration of oxygen-containing functional groups of MPs (P < 0.05), with the strength of H bonds increasing for aged TPUs-SAs and the strength of electrostatic interactions decreasing for aged PA-SAs.

Trapping agent experiments and ESR results indicated that the degradation process was dominated by ·O2- while 1O2 was also a key factor. The upshift of CBM from −0.34 eV (BiOBr) to −0.43 eV (Bi3O4Br) accelerated the production of ·O2-. At the same time, the highly efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs could be attributed to the transformation of O2/·O2- and enhancement of hybridization, which were proven by photoelectrochemical measurement, PL and time-resolved PL spectra. The degradation pathway of TC dominated by ·O2- and 1O2 was also discussed.}

The as-obtained composite exhibited superior performance on peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation over a wide pH range. Complete removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX, 25 mg·L−1) was achieved within 5 min and the reaction rate constant was higher than those of the most reported heterogeneous catalyst/PMS systems for SMX degradation. It was demonstrated that both radical pathways (SO4−, OH, and O2−) and non-radical pathways (1O2 and direct electron transfer) were involved in the SMX degradation. Significantly, the contribution ratio of each reactive oxidative species (ROS) in the bulk solution or on the catalyst surface was differentiated and calculated for the first time. SO4− both in the bulk solution and on the catalyst surface as well as the 1O2 in the bulk solution were the dominant ROS. The possible degradation mechanism of SMX by Co3O4@NPC/rGO/PMS system was proposed. Co active sites with high activity, the electron-rich ketonic group and the nitrogen doping sites within Co3O4@NPC/rGO contributed to the excellent catalytic activity. The ecotoxicity of SMX and its intermediates was investigated. Besides, the reusability, stability and application potential in actual waterbodies of Co3O4@NPC/rGO were evaluated.

abstract = {Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a series of crystalline materials with ordered nanopores, are highly desirable for ultrafast and selective nanofiltration. However, COF-based membranes are typically synthesized via difficult synthetic procedures with long reaction time and show poor mechanical properties, which may hinder their widespread applications. Herein, a facile interfacial method is developed to synthesize COF membranes via the synergistic effect of interfacial diffusion and in-phase Brownian motion. Continuous free-standing COF films with a thickness of 111 nm are obtained within only 3 h under mild reaction conditions. Meanwhile, this synthesis method is suitable for the fabrication of COF membranes with a thin-film-composite (TFC) structure, enabling obtained COF membranes good mechanical properties under external forces and practical nanofiltration tests. Compared with other reported nanofiltration membranes, TFC-COFs exhibit state-of-the-art water permeance (173.94 L m2 h−1 bar−1) and superior rejections exceeding 98.50% to dyes larger than 1.3 nm. Precisely selective sieving of obtained TFC-COFs is systematically studied by separating diverse mixed dye solutions. Furthermore, monomers used in this method can be replaced, creating COF-based membranes with customizable functionality to enable a broad range of selective separations.}

abstract = {Non-thermal plasma-induced one-step desorption of splitting of CO2 has been investigated in this research for carbon capture and utilization. An experimental study was conducted in a plasma-sorbent system that consists of a coaxial DBD reactor packed with hydrotalcite pellets. Operation parameters including discharge power and carrier gas flow rate were varied to explore their effect on the desorption of CO2 from the sorbent and conversion to CO. Results showed that the discharge power plays the dominant role in the desorption process. Faster desorption was achieved with increasing power but at a cost of CO2 conversion. Although the carrier gas flow rate does not have a significant effect on the desorption, higher conversion was achieved with a higher flow rate due to the dilution effect. The maximum single pass conversion of CO2 achieved was 67.44%. Based on the feature of this technology, periodic operation of multiple reactors including reactors in parallel and in series are discussed for continuous CO2 capture and its full conversion.}

abstract = {Direct solar steam generation (DSSG) is well-proven to be a sustainable and effective technique to provide high-quality freshwater supply. However, it customarily suffers from severe salt accumulation, especially for treating strong brine, becoming a fatal bottleneck for approaching its commercial applications. Herein, we developed a DSSG with potent siphon-drop mode to achieve powerful self-absorbing and self-desalting, in which the 3D cone-shaped self-supporting polydopamine and polyethyleneimine co-coated poly(acrylonitrile-styrene-acrylate) (PDA-PEI@ASA) used as photothermal material (PTM). Source water can be spontaneously and continuously pumped to the top of water-evaporating surface of PTM via strong siphon effect, and the top-down active water diffusion on evaporating surface can effectively take the salts away from the system. Such above features give the DSSG real-time antifouling nature and hence address the fatal issue of salt accumulation. Accordingly, when continuously treating a near-saturated brine (20% NaCl) for at least 168 h, no obvious salts deposition can be found with a steady water evaporation rate of ∼2.550 kg m–2 h−1. This work could help shed novel light on the design of practical DSSG systems toward efficient lasting freshwater extraction, holding great promise for global water scarcity.}

The optimum dosages of co-substrate (glucose = 1000 mg/L), zero valent iron (ZVI) (2 g/L), and hydrolysis acidification time (12 h) were explored by batch tests. The results indicated that the concentration of total phenols declined from 636 mg/L to 376 mg/L when the cumulative methane production increased to 145 mL. In the long-term operation of the anaerobic two-phase reactor, 1,000 mg/L glucose was added to the influent, and 2 g/L ZVI was added in the methanogenic phase, respectively. HRTs in acidogenic and methanogenic phases were kept at 12 h and 48 h, respectively. The average acetate and TVFAs concentrations remained at approximately 852 mg/L and 1042 mg/L, respectively. The result showed that the concentrations of influent and effluent COD were approximately 3,191 mg/L and 412 mg/L, respectively, while those of influent and effluent total phenols were approximately 655 mg/L and 23 mg/L, respectively. The removal efficiencies of total COD and total phenols were over 86% and 96%, respectively. In addition, the total methane production rose to 250 mL/d. Microbial community structure analysis demonstrated that the acidogenic phase contained most types of microbial species and the most complex community diversity in the anaerobic system and that direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) might occur between the potential electroactive bacteria Chloroflexi and the archaea Methanobacteriales and Methanosaeta, respectively.}

Although transition metal-nitrogen-carbon moieties have been regarded as efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), they are generally established for four-electron (4e−) pathway, rather than two-electron (2e−) one for selective generation of H2O2. Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve cobalt-carbon hybrids with high 2e− selectivity for H2O2 production in acidic media via tailoring their surface structure and coordination environment. The correlation between 2e− ORR selectivity of the fabricated monolithic electrodes, i.e. Co nanoparticles embedded in N-doped oxo carbon framework (CoNCF), and their oxygen-containing functional groups is revealed. In particular, an excellent H2O2 selectivity over 91 % in 0.05 M H2SO4 is achieved, which exceeds most of previously reported 2e− ORR electrocatalysts. Moreover, a sterilization system for water disinfection is constructed, demonstrating potential practical applications. The smart design of multi-active sites and porous monolithic architecture opens a new avenue for preparing advanced electrode for H2O2 generation and other environment/energy-related systems.}

Herein, we designed atomically dispersed Pt into SnO2 catalyst (Pt atom/SnO2). Such catalyst dramatically improves the adsorption performance of CO2 and lowers the activation energy of CO2. DFT calculations indicate that the doping of Pt in SnO2 could induce charge redistribution and tune active electronic state, showing higher adsorption energy for intermediates CO2*, HCOO* and HCOOH*, which is different from the Pt NPs loaded SnO2 mainly for H2 generation. As a result, a higher Faradaic efficiency (82.1 ± 1.4%) and the production rate (5105 μmol h−1 cm−2) of HCOO– are achieved at −1.2 V vs. RHE. Moreover, the current density and Faradaic efficiency of HCOO– nearly remain unchanged in 8 h on the Pt atom/SnO2, indicating its high stability.

Biodegradation is an attractive option for reducing these residues, but more insight into the mechanism of degradation is necessary to ensure that toxic deadend products are not produced in the process. In this study, a β-cypermethrin (β-CY) degrading bacterium which we named GW-01 was isolated from a sheep’s rumen chyme. HPLC analyses of culture extracts revealed that train GW-01 degraded ∼ 60 % of 100 mg/L β‑CY within 7 d. Strain GW-01 transiently accumulated 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), phenol, and benzoic acid during β-CY degradation. Genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses of GW-01 during degradation of β-CY and its metabolites provided evidence that an α/β- hydrolase and a cytochrome aa3 quinol oxidase were responsible for the degradation of β-CY and 3-PBA, respectively. Chlorohydrolase was implicated in the degradation of phenol to catechol. Transcriptional and proteomic evidence was also found for upregulation of the benzoic acid degradation pathway and meta-pathway (catechol-2,3-dioxygenase), respectively. Based on these results a pathway for β-CY degradation is propose that provides greater insight into the mechanism of pyrethroid degradation by microorganisms.}

abstract = {A major reason that hinders the clinical application of disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) is the unmet challenges in their effective delivery to cartilage. Cationic macromolecules represent promising carriers to enhance the drug delivery to cartilage through their electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged cartilage matrix. However, current candidate cationic macromolecular carriers (CMCs) must solve the intractable challenges in scalable production and biosafety before they can be used clinically. ε-poly-l-lysine (ε-PLL) is a unique poly (amino acid) that has favorable features to conquer the above issues. In this study, we evaluated the potential of ε-PLL as a cost effectiveness, biosafety, and effective CMC for drug delivery to cartilage. Cartilage explant from pig knee was used as a model for the in vitro analysis of ε-PLL’s interaction with, penetration into, and resident in cartilage tissue. The results showed that ε-PLL had a strong distribution tendency in cartilage with partition coefficient K ∼ 4.3 and weak cartilage matrix binding ability (KD ∼ 310 μM) with abundant intra-cartilage binding sites (N ∼ 9900 μM). Furthermore, ε-PLL could also penetrate full thickness cartilage and showed a long-time retention in cartilage explants and mouse joint cavity. The results of in vitro and in vivo toxicity tests showed nearly no negative impact of ε-PLL (100 μg/mL) on chondrocytes or local tissue. Using kartogenin (KGN, a potential DMOAD) as a model drug, the effectiveness of ε-PLL to improve the drug bioavailability in a mouse OA model was proved. Together, these results suggest that ε-PLL can be used as an effective and safe CMC for effective DMOAD delivery to cartilage.}

Solar light-assisted catalytic conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals has been considered viable to mitigate the environmental and energy crisis simultaneously. In this regard, an artificial photosynthesis system, often called “artificial leaf” consisting of substantial structural components and reaction parameters of natural photosynthesis to attain solar light-driven CO2 conversion, is up-and-coming. Inspired by natural leaves, photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic artificial leaf structures that mimic natural photosynthesis and efficiently utilize solar energy to convert CO2 into value-added products are of great significance. This review focuses on the basic concepts of photo/electrocatalytic artificial leaf systems, emphasizing advanced structural arrangements and the mechanistic insights for CO2 reduction. The recent advances in the structural design of artificial leaves involving Z-scheme biocatalytic photoelectrochemical devices, photocatalytic prototype, and latest 3D printing has been extensively explored and discussed. The crucial applications of artificial leaf devices for the selective conversion of CO2 into carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and formate have been outlined. Finally, we conclude and provide a vision with an in-depth discussion on how the present state-of-the-art advances and various challenges in this field. We expect to believe this comprehensive study could stimulate more remarkable research efforts to design efficient artificial leaf for light-driven CO2 reduction towards selective solar-to-chemical products in the coming years.}

abstract = {Developing highly efficient, stable, and earth-abundant heterogeneous electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a significant challenge. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel core–shell trimetallic Ni0.70Fe0.10V0.20S2 @ amorphous NiFe hydroxide for enhancing OER kinetics using thermal sulfidation and in situ electrochemical tuning methods. Electrochemical testing of various as-prepared catalysts at the same mass loading demonstrated that the trimetallic Ni0.70Fe0.10V0.20S2 @ amorphous NiFe hydroxide possessed the highest intrinsic activity for the OER compared to other reference catalysts. Furthermore, the heterostructures are directly grown on a carbon paper with a high surface area and good conductivity to form an integrated 3D electrode with an overpotential of 204 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec-1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. This is one of the most effective OER electrocatalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy indicated that the material structure and chemical composition of Ni0.70Fe0.10V0.20S2 @ amorphous NiFe hydroxide exhibited good stability under harsh OER conditions. These advantages could be mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between the core and shell, high electronic conductivity of the core, and more active sites on the surface of the amorphous shell. Additionally, this study provides novel insights for designing and synthesizing heterostructure multimetallic disulfides electrocatalysts for OER in the future.}

abstract = {Novel, durably flame-retardant cotton fabrics with fascinatingly restorable fire resistance were prepared by simple grafting of phosphate and melamine, which contributed to a phosphorous-nitrogen (P/N) synergism. During the preparation process, phosphate was grafted with the hydroxyl groups of cellulose to form P-O-C bonds; subsequently, melamine reacted with the aldehyde groups of cellulose generated from phosphorylation to form P/N modified fabrics (P/N-Cotton). The P/N synergistic effect endowed cotton fabric with prominent fire resistance and durability. The Limit oxygen index (LOI) was as high as 51.1 ± 0.3% and was maintained at 32.7 ± 0.8% after 50 laundering cycles (LCs). The total heat release (THR) and peak values of heat release rate (pHRR) of P/N-Cotton were significantly reduced by 70.11% and 64.19%, respectively. Amazingly, the modified cotton fabrics exhibited restorable fire resistance once immersed into the acetic acid solution due to the ion exchange between Na+ from detergent and H+ from acetic acid. The LOI of P-Cotton and P/N-Cotton after 50 LCs can be restored to 32.4 ± 0.7% and 35.7 ± 0.7% from 20.8 ± 0.7% and 32.7 ± 0.8%, respectively. The analysis of gas-phase products and residual char demonstrated that the incorporation of phosphate and melamine facilitated cellulose fibers to convert to dense and stable graphitized carbon layers and carbon-nitrogen heterocycles, effectively protecting the fabric from decomposing to flammable gases.}

Herein, hydroxylated Ti3C2/Ti3AlC2 (h-TC/TAC) catalysts were prepared via an alkaline etching process using a safer, more environmentally friendly alkali. After preferentially forming a hydroxylated Ti3C2 MXene layer on the surface of Ti3AlC2, Ti-C bonds on the surface were partially hydrolyzed, which exposed more active sites. Alkaline etching modulated the chemical composition and electronic structure of the catalyst surface, thus concentrating the active sites on the surface, which improved the activation efficiency and substrate conversion. For the aerobic oxidative desulfurization of a model fuel with a sulfur content of 220 ppm, the prepared catalyst exhibited a desulfurization rate of up to 99% when using air as a cheap molecular oxygen source. The enhanced activity of the h-TC/TAC catalyst was attributed to the continuous activation of molecular oxygen to form •OH and •O2–. Moreover, because the main structure of Ti3AlC2 was maintained, the catalyst could be recycled 8 times without a significant decrease in activity. This work not only shows the potential of alkaline etching for preparing MXene materials but also provides an important example of the thermocatalytic application of MXene and MAX phase materials.}

However, it is still at the infant stage as the unsatisfactory of the design strategies for bifunctional catalysts toward both HzOR and hydrogen evolution, which leads to high working potential compared to the theoretical value. Here, for the first time, we report a galvanostatic immobilization of ruthenium single atoms (Ru SAs) into the oxygen vacancy of urchin-like tungsten trioxide (Vo-WO3) and show low overpotentials of 17, 34, and 64 mV at –10 mA cm–2 under acid, alkaline, and neutral H2 evolution, respectively. As an efficient bifunctional catalyst, the Vo-WO3/Ru SAs is firstly introduced to HzOR and achieves low working potential of –58 mV at 10 mA cm–2. The HzOR-assisted OWS also delivers an ultralow cell voltage of only 25 mV at 10 mA cm–2 in alkaline medium, which is far beyond the platinum and most of the state-of-the-art catalysts. Additionally, this coupled system can also be well performed under neutral condition, realizing a cell voltage of only 137 mV at 10 mA cm–2. The excellent pH-universal HzOR-assisted OWS activity is attributed to the particular electronic configuration between Ru SAs and WO3, the immobilization of Ru SAs in WO3 could induce electron redistribution and optimize free energy of hydrogen adsorption in hydrogen evolution, while the isolation of Ru SAs also leads to the electropositivity of W sites and tends to accelerate the oxidation of hydrazine.}

It is highly plausible that the strong chemical interaction can change the crystallinity as well as bonding nature of anode materials. This highlights the importance of chemical interaction with carbon and its effects on the material and electrochemical properties of anode materials. However, this is not yet investigated. This study is the first report on the amorphization of layered structured GeSe induced by the chemical interaction and its implications on the electrochemical properties for K-ion batteries. The charge storage mechanism of GeSe/CNT composite, investigated using ex-situ X-ray diffraction, indicates that reversible conversion-alloying reaction of GeSe is realized by the amorphization, which is closely linked with weakening of Ge–Se bonds derived from the strong chemical interaction and a concomitant increase in K-ion diffusion. As a result, the GeSe/CNT composite exhibits excellent electrochemical properties. Similar amorphization driven by chemical interaction is also observed for other layered structured anode materials. This study provides new insights on the chemical interaction of layered anode materials with carbon. Our findings could effectively be used to realize reversible conversion reaction for other anode materials for advanced secondary batteries.}

This study investigated the kinetics, transformation pathways, DBPs formation, and toxicity alternation in the degradation of sulfamethazine (SMT). Based on the calculation of degradation kinetic models, RNS was proved to be the most important reactive species in the degradation of SMT in UV/NH2Cl. The contribution of RNS, HO• and RCS were approximately 56.6%, 38.8%, and 4.5%, respectively. With the NH2Cl dosage increased from 100 to 800 µmol L-1, degradation rate increased from 37% to 73% in 10 min. Significantly alternation was not observed with the changing of pH. Natural organic matter (NOM) remarkably inhibited the degradation rate to 48.6% and 32.8% in the presence of 1 and 2 mg L-1 NOM. Degradation reactions of SMT in UV/NH2Cl system primarily comprised of hydroxylation, nitrosation, and ring opening reactions. The total theoretical toxicity of degradation system increased in the first 20 min and decreased eventually. Comparing with UV/free chlorine (UV/Cl2) process, less disinfection by-products (DBPs) generated in UV/NH2Cl treatment. Thus, the theoretical toxicity of DBPs formed in UV/NH2Cl was much lower than UV/Cl2. Within 40 min degradation, the theoretical toxicity value reached maximum at pH 7.1 due to the mass production of dicloroacetonitrile (DCAN). Bromide ions (10 µmol L-1) significantly promoted the formation of brominated DBPs especially dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN). This study provided insight into the important role of RNS in the SAs’ transformation in UV/NH2Cl process and reference to benefits and disadvantages when selecting the process for disinfection in drinking water treatment.}

For the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) devices, a high energy density of 30.16 Wh kg−1 at 0.7 kW kg−1 was achieved.

Traditionally, photo-thermal storage performance has been limited by the low thermal conductivity of PCMs and the massive heat transfer loss between PCMs and their external environment. Herein, we demonstrate that embedding a highly oriented graphite sheet (GS) network in a PCM results in an anisotropic thermal conduction structure, endowing the material with rapid internal thermal conduction and reduced heat loss to the external environment, thereby enhancing photo-thermal storage performance. We imitate the structure of layer cake to create a multilayered composite phase change material (CPCM), Mg(NO3)2∙6H2O/g-C3N4-GS (MNH/CN-GS), which has a highly oriented anisotropic thermal conductivity. The through-plane and in-plane thermal conductivities of MNH/CN-GS reach 0.55 and 15.70 W/(m·K), respectively, at 40 wt% GS loading in the CN-GS matrix. This corresponds to a high anisotropic degree of thermal conduction of 28.56, which results in a high average photo-thermal storage efficiency of 88.4%. The photo-thermal storage efficiency remains above 80% even at a high temperature of approximately 94 ℃. The proposed anisotropic thermal conduction structure eliminates the trade-off between high photo-thermal conversion rate and high energy efficiency in solar thermal storage.}

In terms of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) derivatives, however, scarce studies have dedicated to the relevant aspects. Herein, EPFRs have been detected in Bi-metal organic layers (Bi-MOLs) derivatives. The corresponding g-factors and concentrations of EPFRs on Bi2O3@C by pyrolyzed at different temperatures were 2.0041–2.0046 and 7.04 × 1019-1.77 × 1020 spins/g, respectively. Interestingly, similar EPFRs signals were also monitored in HKUST-1 based and UiO-66 based derivatives. We observed that Bi2O3@C system with the highest EPFRs concentration exhibited superior degradation and mineralization efficiency for phenol and tetracycline. Its excellent photocatalytic performance was mainly attributed to the interaction between the internal EPFRs and photoinduced active species, which promoted more generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) radicals. This hypothesis was supported by line correlations for EPFRs concentration vs. degradation kinetics in samples pyrolyzed at different temperatures (R2 = 0.946). Most significantly, mechanism investigation combined with DFT calculation indicated that the EPFRs not only promote the generation of 1O2 and •OH via molecular oxygen activation pathway but also provided a possibility of enhancing water oxidation by holes. These findings pave the way for MOFs derivative's implication and insight into the role of EPFRs in photocatalysis.}

abstract = {Tuning the luminescent properties of phosphors by crystal-site engineering is a good and efficient strategy for developing high-quality white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, it is still challenging to modulate the cyan to red spectral emission in a single matrix and activator phosphor to obtain multicolor output and achieve full-visible-spectrum lighting. Herein, the strategy to manipulate site-selective occupation of Eu2+ activators by substituting the cation Rb+ with K+ is reported to obtain a versatile color output. The large-scale redshift regulation of emission spectrum from cyan to red was achieved in fluor-phosphate Rb2-yKyCaPO4F: 0.0085Eu2+ (R2-yKyCPOF: 0.0085Eu2+) (0 ≤ y ≤ 1.8) phosphors, which is designed by using Rb2CaPO4F: 0.0085Eu2+ (RCPOF: 0.0085Eu2+) cyan-emitting phosphor. The redistribution of Eu2+ ions in Rb1, Rb2, and Ca sites is achieved by introducing the cation K+ to substitute Rb+, and R2-yKyCPOF: 0.0085Eu2+ (0 ≤ y ≤ 1.8) is kept in the pure phase. Furthermore, the mixed phosphors of RCPOF: 0.0085Eu2+, RKCPOF: 0.0085Eu2+, and R0.2K1.8CPOF: 0.0085Eu2+ show excellent optical performance and good thermal stability. Full-visible spectrum lighting is successfully achieved with the combination of a 395 nm NUV chip and the blend of phosphor-converted WLEDs. The K+ substitution reported in this paper can support a project for warm WLEDs by manipulating the distribution of Eu2+ activator among different cation sites.}

abstract = {Charge-selective contacts can play a critical role in enhancing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, we employed fluorine-functionalized graphene (FGr) layers having finely tunable energy levels as hole transport layers (HTLs) to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of inverted PSCs. The non-wetting surface of the FGr enhanced the crystallinity of organic–inorganic perovskites films with large aspect ratios, relative to that of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). Combining the high work function of the HTL interface with the enhanced crystallinity and limited grain boundary area dramatically decreased the charge recombination losses in organic–inorganic trihalide perovskite (OTP) films. Thus, when incorporating FGr HTLs in inverted PSCs, the best PCE reached 19.34%—the highest efficiency reported to date for any PSC featuring a functionalized graphene HTL. Furthermore, we used this HTL to prepare flexible PSCs and obtained a highest efficiency of 17.50%. Therefore, this highly applicable and facile interface strategy using functionalized graphene HTLs provides stable PSCs displaying high PCEs.}

First, the influence of the Fe2+:PMS molar ratio on the obtained degradation efficiency was investigated and an excess of Fe2+ was found to result in a decrease in SMX degradation efficiency, while, for the investigated molar ratios, an excess of PMS was found to enhance the degradation efficiency. To obtain a higher degradation efficiency, the dosing strategy of the reagents was altered: from direct dosing (introducing the reagents all at once) to sequential dosing (adding the same total amount of reagent, but divided over specific time intervals) and continuous dosing (adding the same total amount of reagent, but continuously over 30 min reaction time). Continuous dosing of both Fe2+ and PMS was found to be the optimal strategy, with a SMX degradation efficiency of 67% in 50 min reaction time. By performing scavenging experiments, the reactive species (•OH, •SO4- and Fe(IV) present in this process were identified. It was found that the contribution of •OH to the degradation of SMX increased when changing from direct to continuous dosing. Lastly, the formed degradation products were identified, and differences in reaction pathway depending on the reactive species present were elucidated.}

However, practical development of solid-state zinc-air batteries is hindered by the low specific areal capacity and poor contact between solid-state electrolyte and electrode caused by zinc passivation and electrolyte aging. Herein, we report a new strategy for optimizing the solid-state electrolyte/electrode interface coupling by combining porous zinc electrode and thermal-sensitive solid-state electrolyte F127 to improve the areal-capacity of solid-state zinc-air batteries. The porous Zn anode prepared by zinc electrodeposition on the zinc substrate is used to alleviate zinc passivation and improve the specific area capacity of SZAB. In addition, to enhance the contact between the solid-state electrolyte and the zinc anode, the F127 surfactant is selected as the solid-state electrolyte due to its fluidity at low temperatures. Benefiting from the porous structure and excellent contact, the SZAB using porous zinc anode and the solid-state electrolyte F127 exhibits high areal capacity of 133 mAh cm−2 at the current density of 4 mA cm−2, which is 100 times higher than that of the solid zinc-air battery using zinc foil as the anode. Moreover, the results show that the use of porous zinc electrodes is conducive to achieving high current discharge, which is critical for the practical application of solid-state zinc-air batteries.}

However, soft tissues with highly ordered hierarchical nanocomposite structures exhibit anisotropic mechanical performance and function to adapt the complex environments. Therefore, the introduction of an ordered nanocomposite structure into hydrogel is an effective strategy to endow the hydrogel with superb mechanical strength and excellent anisotropic functions. Here, we develop a method to create anisotropic hydrogels with significantly enhanced mechanical and tribological properties. Based on mussel adhesion chemistry, polydopamine (PDA) was used as a mediator to control the formation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of montmorillonite (MMT). Subsequently, the obtained PDA-Fe3O4-MMT nanohybrids in the polyvinyl alcohol/polyacrylic acid (PVA/PAA) hydrogel matrix were aligned to form an ordered structure using magnetic-induced technology and then frozen in hydrogel form by freezing-thawing and annealing methods. The resulting hydrogels showed an anisotropic microstructure and exhibited outstanding mechanical properties with a tensile strength of 10.65 MPa, toughness of 52.2 MJ/m3, and compressive strength of 4.86 MPa, which is higher than that of the corresponding isotropic hydrogel. More interestingly, the friction coefficient of hydrogel is significantly reduced to as low as 0.038 due to the presence of ordered structure. This work not only improves magnetic induction technology for the preparation of anisotropic hydrogels but also provides a simple and effective method to obtain hydrogels with anisotropic structure, high mechanical strength, and anisotropic properties for potential application in tissue engineering.}

Nevertheless, little is known about the formation of the micro-particles associated microorganisms as well as their metabolic functions, which could be largely impacted by carbon sources in the influent. Here, protein and glucose were chosen to be two different carbon sources fed into two identical AnMBRs (i.e., AnMBR-P and AnMBR-G), and a comprehensive comparison of the micro-particles formed in corresponding reactors was made. Size-dependent fractionation and fluorescent staining assay showed that micro-particles with the size range of 0.45–1 μm possessed the highest contents (41.4%) in the AnMBR-P and presented as vibrios and coccus, while the 5–10 μm micro-particles with filamentous morphologies were the prevailing fraction (61.9%) in the AnMBR-G. According to the results of high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the Lentimicrobiaceae, D8A-2 and Syntrophorhabdus prevailed in the AnMBR-P micro-particles, while the SJA-15 showed overwhelming predominance than the other genera in the AnMBR-G micro-particles. Metagenomic sequencing further revealed that the micro-particles in the AnMBR-P possessed higher abundance in specific functional genes for nitrogen metabolism (nirB), sulfur metabolism (cysK) and cysteine and methionine metabolism (mtaD), as well as in the cell mobility as chemotaxis (rbsB) and flagellar assembly (fliC). In comparison, the micro-particles obtained from the AnMBR-G encoded abundant genes for converting glucose to metabolites in the next level, such as glk (glucokinase), pfk (ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase), and PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase). Overall, our findings provided new insights into the formation of micro-particles in the supernatant of AnMBRs, which could facilitate to propose related fouling alleviation methods from the perspective of carbon sources regulation and/or pretreatment of the influent.}

Herein, we present a facile wet chemical synthesis to prepare uniform and well-dispersed SnS nanosheet crystals. Low-rate initial production with 3.5 L solvent was performed to obtain high-quality crystals, and also to adapt the process to commercial preparation. The carrier concentrations were enhanced from 3.2×1018 cm−3 to 4.8×1019 cm−3 (at 873 K) step-by-step via increasing Sn vacancies, adding SnSe, and embedding Ag atoms. The maximum power factor (PF) at 873 K of 0.48×10−3 W⋅m−1K−2 was achieved in the selenium-silver co-doped sample, which presented a state-of-the-art value for the polycrystalline SnS. Correspondingly, the lattice thermal conductivities (κL) decreased from 0.8 W⋅m−1K−1 to 0.47 W⋅m−1K−1 (at 873 K) due to enhanced phonon scattering. The highest zT was 0.80 at 873 K, which is about 5 or 6 times higher than those of the pristine SnS(1:1) or SnS(1:0.8) samples. These findings provide a novel method to prepare high-quality and high-performance TE semiconductors via a wet chemical synthesis.}

Random eating or eating irregular meals and poor patient compliance with lifestyle changes often happens and makes more difficult to control glycemic variability in life through hypoglycemic drugs around meals. The inhibition of the activity of digestion enzymes in the gut represents an effective strategy for prevention and treatment of glycemic variability. In this study, immune response was employed to induce antibodies (immunoglobulin of egg yolk, IgY) against α-amylase through the subcutaneous injection of α-amylase as the antigen in laying hens. IgY-coupled magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel as α-amylase inhibitor was further developed for long-time against glycemic variability. IgY was covalently coupled to PEG-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles (PEG/Fe3O4@IgY nanoparticles) and then fabricated by embedding of PEG/Fe3O4@IgY nanoparticles in chitosan-alginate (CS/AS) hydrogels. Under the external magnetic field, lgY-coupled magnetic nanocomposites as α-amylase inhibitors were magnetically anchored in the small intestine for long-time against glycemic variability, resulting in a long-time (>36 h) and effective postprandial hyperglycemia management. This study opens a new door to the health care of the metabolic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease.}

However, interface materials for multi-functional treatment have been rarely investigated in PSCs. In this work, a novel pyrene-based organic material (TAAPyr) is first introduced as a defect passivation layer and a protect layer against moisture for PSCs application. With the TAAPyr interfacial modification, both perovskite surface defects and nonradiative recombination are effectively decreased as well as the carrier transport in device is also enhanced, As a consequence, the best power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 22.45% for TAAPyr-based device was obtained, clearly outperforming the control one (20.37%). Moreover, it was found that the π-conjugated TAAPyr can promote intermolecular face-to-face stacking on the surface perovskite film, which is favorable to making the perovskite surface more hydrophobic and consequently enhance PSCs long-term stability. The un-encapsulated PSCs can retain 92% of the initial PCE after storage for 600 h at ∼65% RH, in comparison with 64% efficiency retention of the device without TAAPyr under the same conditions. This work presents a new strategy to enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs by multi-functional π–conjugated passivator.}

Herein, defect-rich layered double hydroxide (LDH) structured into a fibrous filter with a facile solar-driven regeneration function was fabricated for efficiently removing adsorbed CECs in wastewater. The physical and chemical interactions between the LDH filter and CECs are revealed. It is demonstrated that the introduction of unsaturated Cuδ+ sites (δ < 2) and creating oxygen vacancies represents an effective way for improving adsorbing activity of the defect-rich LDH host layer. Also, the nanofiber-particle friction coefficient of the hierarchical LDH filter affects the filtration efficiency as revealed by 3D modelling. The LDH filter is capable of filtrating sixteen types of CECs and shows the capability of photocatalytic degradation of adsorbed CECs, thus enabling filter regeneration. This work thus presents a new perspective into bottom-up design of adsorbent materials: from molecular interactions to shaping adsorbents into microscopic nanofibers and assembling these into macroscopic 3D adsorbent filters.}

Here, we propose a facile nanostructuring strategy for enhancing the PEC performance of molybdenum-doped BiVO4 (Mo:BiVO4) photoanodes by varying the molecular weight of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a pore former. It was demonstrated that the grain and pore sizes of Mo:BiVO4 could be controlled by changing the molecular weight of PEG. Nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes with optimized grain and pore sizes revealed an effective charge separation efficiency of 72% and showed the highest photocurrent density of 2.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE). After hydrogen treatment and decoration of nickel iron (oxy)hydroxide (NiFeOOH) as an oxygen evolution catalyst, a stable photocurrent density of 4.5 mA cm−2 with a 10-h duration was achieved at 1.23 VRHE under standard 1-sun illumination.

The resultant conductivity was respectively estimated as 2022 S/cm (PA-treated) and 2270 S/cm (GtA-treated), in comparison with that of the ordinarily prepared film (∼0.9 S/cm). By analyzing the PEDOT/PSS ratio, phase morphology, as well as benzenoid/quinoid conformation, crystalline structure, the mechanism on conductivity enhancement was systematically elucidated. Based on the density functional theory, the synergistic effect of carboxy and phenol groups was verified as the origin of excellent doping-efficiency of these two biomass-derived modifiers. What is more, an ITO-free OLED device was successfully fabricated, where the PA or GtA-treated PEDOT:PSS was employed as transparent conducting electrode. Surprisingly, a remarkable improvement with regard to device performance was observed, in spite of the not good enough conductivity relative to ITO. Using the PA/GtA-modified electrodes, the external quantum efficiency (EQE), current efficiency, and power efficiency of OLED devices is elevated by 50–300% at the brightness of 100 cd/m2 for electronic display application. To reveal the underlying mechanism, the energy levels and the light extraction were examined and then ascribed to the paradox. The findings present a possible strategy to construct high-efficiency OLEDs relying on organic transparent electrodes and a promising application of biomass-derived chemicals.}

Though preliminary studies on modified anodes by small organic molecules were reported, the goal-directed design and regulation of such compounds have been sparsely reported so far, thus limiting device performances. Herein, D-o-D type triphenylamine derivatives with non-conjugated linkage of sp3 oxygen are proposed to finely tune the energy level alignment and enhance the defect passivation at the ITO/perovskite interface, thus facilitating the efficient charge extraction at the anodes. The optimized molecules considerably ameliorate the photovoltaic performances of the corresponding inverted PSCs, engendering a preeminent power-conversion-efficiency (PCE) of 20.57% with negligible hysteresis. Remarkably, a good long-term stability is recorded for the unencapsulated device with over 94% of the initial PCE maintained after 180 days storage in N2 condition. Those improved performances validate the feasibility of the D-o-D molecules for cost-effective PSCs with high-efficiency, and excellent long-term stability.}

Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a central regulator of lipid peroxidation, was found signigicantly up-regulated in colorectal tumors, which inhibits tumor cell ferroptosis. To leverage ferroptosis combating colorectal cancer, here we report a Hypoxia-responsive nanoelicitor (HRNE) for promoting lipid peroxidation and thus facilitating ferroptosis by relieving GPX4-mediated brake. By self-assembling of immune-elicitable polyphenols, Chlorogenic acid (CA) and Mitoxantrone (MIT), with Fe3+ ions, the self-deliverable nanoelicitors were constructed and then cloaked with a hypoxia-responsive hybrid liposomal membrane. In the hypoxic tumor, the liposomal shell discomposed and the nanoelicitor was burst released. Ferroptosis-inducible Fe2+ accompanied with toxic reactive oxygen species was produced via Fenton reaction. An activated tumoricidal immunity was simultaneously co-stimulated by MIT and CA, through which the system xc− to GPX4 pathway was aborted, and the facilitated lipid peroxidation in turn promoted the iron-initiated tumor cell damage. We highlight the nanoelicitor significantly attenuated the GPX4-mediated inhibition of lipid peroxidation by activating a robust tumoricidal immunity and thus synergistically potentiated cancer cell ferroptosis.}

abstract = {Mitigation of climate change by reducing the anthropogenic CO2 emissions has recently gained huge momentum. A prime pathway to achieve it in the short-medium term lies within capturing CO2 from industries’ flue gases. Post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) is the most mature methodology for large-scale CO2 capture and closest to market. However, the conventional chemical absorption-based PCC process implies high regeneration energy requirements, constituting the majority of the energy load when adding PCC to the plant from which the CO2 is going to be captured. As such, reducing the overall parasitic load of the conventional process is of interest. Changing the solvent or improving the process flowsheet are two main methodologies to achieve higher energetic efficiency and lower exergy losses. As there are several reviews dealing with novel solvents, this review critically evaluates the progress in improving the conventional PCC process through modifications of process configurations and shadowed by solvent replacements as drop-in solutions. The process configurations were grouped into absorption and stripping enhancement categories. A comparative analysis was conducted between the different available schemes in the literature and interactions between solvents and process configurations were showcased, highlighting the advantages and shortcomings of some of them. The review reveals the need for standardized framework and optimization algorithms using exergo-economic performance indicators for integrated solvent and process synthesis.}

abstract = {This study uses empirical observations and mass transfer simulations to establish a new mechanism for microwave pyrolysis of biomass. Experiments were conducted on cellulose and hemicellulose, using microwave equipment that could vary the observed heating rate. No microwave-absorbing additives were used. At high heating rates it is shown categorically that microwave pyrolysis can significantly reduce the pyrolysis temperatures for hemicellulose and cellulose, but when microwave heating is used to deliver a low heating rate the pyrolysis behaviour is identical to that obtained with conventional heating. Dielectric properties are shown to vary by over an order of magnitude depending on the heating rate. The implications of heating rate on mass transfer and phase behaviour are developed and discussed within the paper, with liquid-phase water identified as a key driver for the observed differences in the microwave pyrolysis process. This is the first study in microwave pyrolysis that is able to reconcile microwave heating phenomena against simple and well-understood mass transfer and phase equilibria effects. As a result, a number of processing strategies have emerged with the potential to use microwave heating to enable more selective pyrolysis and bio-oils with more targeted quality than has been possible with conventional approaches.}

Herein, a low-cost magnetic porous carbon ZIF-67/CS@C derived from ZIF-67 and agricultural waste corn stalk (CS) is designed and applied for adsorptive removal of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam from water. The adsorbent is fabricated by carbonizing ZIF-67/CS hybrid pre-prepared through an in-situ decoration of ZIF-67 on the surface of CS, and then acid picking to elute the unstable constituents. In the carbonization, Co2+ ions are reduced to magnetic Co0 nanoparticles, with the result that ZIF-67/CS@C shows a strong magnetic response (saturation magnetization intensity is 12.25 emu‧g−1) and can be easily magnetically separated. Meanwhile, Co nanoparticles are protectively encapsulated in well-developed graphitized wall, which endows ZIF-67/CS@C with good acid resistance (only 0.23% of Co is leached out at pH 1.0). More importantly, reasonable pore size distribution (most pore sizes match or are 3–6 times that of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) and high external surface area (280 m2‧g−1) are obtained, which makes ZIF-67/CS@C super adsorbent. The adsorption capacities for imidacloprid and thiamethoxam can reach as high as 189 and 133 mg‧g−1, respectively. Moreover, after six consecutive recycling processes, the adsorption efficiencies are still above 95%, which reveals excellent reusability of ZIF-67/CS@C. Mechanism analysis affirms that pore-filling, H-bond, and π-π EDA interaction are mainly responsible for driving imidacloprid and thiamethoxam adsorption. Finally, ZIF-67/CS@C with a great security towards Daphnia carinata survival and wheat growth is eco-friendly. This study can be easily adapted to different biomass wastes and MOFs, thus potentially enabling the preparation of more novel adsorbents.}

However, the growth of Li dendrites caused by the uneven Li deposition would lead to poor electrochemical performance and batteries safety risks, which seriously hinders the practical applications of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a scalable modification with a PVDF-HFP/Y0.08Zr0.92O2-δ composite coating on commercial polypropylene (PP) separators is proposed for dendrites-free Li metal batteries. The porous PVDF-HFP matrix derived by phase inversion can act as a redistributor to regulate Li+ flux, while the oxygen vacancies in Y0.08Zr0.92O2-δ nanoparticles act as anion absorbers to increase the lithium ion transference number which promotes a homogenous Li deposition and fast-charging capability. The synergetic effects of Li redistributor and anion absorber can make LMBs achieve a high average coulombic efficiency (98.4% over 500 cycles), prolonged life span (over 1000 h) and enhanced rate performance (155 mAh g−1 at 10 C). This work provides a feasible strategy for separator modification (e.g. changing the anion absorber to a polysulfide absorber for lithium sulfur batteries) to construct dendrite-free and fast-charging LMBs.}

Herein, conductive carbon nanoparticles (Ketjen Black, KB) covered by borocarbonitride (BCN) are assembled into micro-sized particles to form a polar KB@BCN hybrid, which is employed as a sulfur host with enhanced tap density via a facile intergrowth method. At a molecular level, BCN, endowed with abundant adsorption sites as the adsorbent and catalyst, can adsorb polysulfides and catalyze the conversion of polysulfides. On the nanometer scale, the BCN is loaded on the highly conductive KB nanoparticles, which can improve the conductivity of the hybrid (1786 S m−1), thereby improving the conversion of polysulfides. On the micrometer scale, the BCN and the KB nanoparticles together form micro-sized particles to improve the tap density, which is beneficial to build thick electrodes and reduce the amount of electrolyte. When applied as a sulfur cathode, KB@BCN-2 shows good cycling capability (a low-capacity decay of 0.05% after 800 cycles at 0.5C) and high rate performance (765 mA h g−1 at 3.0C). Even under a lean electrolyte condition (E/S = 5 μL mg−1), the KB@BCN-2-S has a high initial capacity of 1266 mA h g−1 at 0.1C.

The PMF was prepared by the electrophoretic deposition of MOF nanoparticles on a porous nickel foam. The MOF nanoparticles were uniformly coated on a large-sized conductive Nickel foam (up to a 10 cm diameter) without uncoated metal foam. To evaluate the adsorption/removal performance of VOCs on the developed PMF, a testbed system, including a photoionization detector, a carbon dioxide sensor, an ultraviolet (UV) light-emitting diode module, and a fan module, was developed, and a filter system was set up. The fabricated PMF showed excellent adsorption and decomposition of the adsorbed VOCs under UV light due to the high specific surface area and photocatalytic property of MIL-100(Fe). The average adsorption and removal performances of the PMF for 10 experiments were 94.25% and 75.95%, respectively. In the durability test, the PMF indicated 72.65% removal efficiency after conducting recycling tests 50 times, and the structure of the PMF was stable. Our approach provides an easy method for preparing MOF-based photocatalytic filters for use in an indoor VOC purification system. We believe that the prepared PMF has good stability and durability for VOC removal and can be applied to various applications such as home, automobile, office, and industry.}

Aiming to enhance the biosensing detection of hazardous substances at high ambient temperatures, we focused on the design and construction of a thermal self-regulatory smart biosensor through an innovative combination of phase change material (PCM) and bioelectrocatalytic material. A bioelectrocatalytic phase-change microcapsule system was first fabricated by microencapsulating n-eicosane as a PCM core in the TiO2 shell and then depositing polypyrrole (PPy) as an electroactive coating layer on the surface of TiO2 shell, followed by immobilizing horseradish peroxidase on the surface of PPy coating layer through physical adsorption. The resultant microcapsules exhibit a regular spherical morphology and layer-by-layer core–shell microstructure with the desired chemical compositions. The microcapsules not only exhibit a good thermal management ability to perform effective temperature regulation under a latent-heat capacity of approximately 115 J/g, but also reveal high thermal impact resistance and good thermal cycle stability for the long-term thermal management application in biosensors. A working electrode was modified with the microcapsules obtained above and then used to construct an electrochemical biosensing system imparted with a thermal self-regulation capability. With a high sensitivity of 5.571 µA·L·µmol−1·cm−2 and a low detection limit of 5.384 µmol/L at 55 °C, the resultant smart biosensor exhibits a better determination ability to detect catechol as a model hazardous substance at high operation temperatures than conventional biosensors thanks to the in-situ thermal management derived from its n-eicosane core. This study provides a new approach for development of thermal self-regulatory smart biosensors with an enhanced identification capability to detect hazardous substances over a wide range of temperatures.}

abstract = {Rational design and synthesis of novel organic electrodes have captured growing attention for the development of sustainable sodium ion batteries (SIBs), but the battery performance has been significantly limited by poor reversible specific capacity and cycling ability. Here, we report a simple structural modulation approach for creating a new type of triazine compounds as anode materials displaying superior SIB performance. We find that trihydroxyphenyl functionalities conjugated with the triazine ring enhance electrochemical affinities for Na-ion trapping, thereby promoting reversible Na-ion insertion/deinsertion. The resultant trihydroxyl-modulated triazine-based anode exhibits an exceptional battery capacity, reaching as high as 650 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and ranks at the top among all reported molecular SIB electrodes. The simple modulation approach not only enables us to achieve exceptional sodium storage but simultaneously provides a means to extends our understanding of structure–property relationship and facilitate new possibilities for organic SIBs.}

MoO3 has good catalytic properties, and its layered structure can provide good ion flow channels and embedding positions. In this study, mechanical mixtures of B/MoO3 and B/Mo were prepared. The promotion of B combustion by MoO3 and Mo was confirmed via combustion heat and burning rate tests. The mechanism by which Mo/MoO3 promote B combustion was studied by thermal analysis, high-temperature in situ X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The maximum heat release and burning rate of B/MoO3 and B/Mo were 2.49 and 2.62 and 2.67 and 2.55 times, respectively, those of raw boron. A pre-ignition reaction occurred when boron first came into contact with the surface of MoO3. The oxygen vacancies on the MoO3 surface served as reaction sites for boron. MoO3 promoted the combustion of B by opening up oxygen channels and improving the oxygen transport capability. Mo also effectively promoted boron combustion. B/Mo and B/MoO3 have promising future applications as high energy release materials.}

To analyze its hydraulic and mixing performances, this paper numerically studies the pressure drop and mixing efficiency of fluid flow in a microchannel mounted with a cylinder and vertical flexible flag (CCFF) with different height and deformability in a wide range of Reynolds number Red based on the cylinder diameter. The simple channel without cylinder and flag (SC) and the channel with cylinder and rigid flag (CCRF) are also studied as comparisons. It is found that the mixing within CCFF occurs mainly due to the molecular diffusion at small and moderate Red, and its pressure drop and mixing efficiency increase with the increasing flag height. At large Red, the mixing in CCFF is highly enhanced by the vortices detached from the vibrating flag, and its pressure drop and mixing efficiency first increase and then reach a slight decrease or quasi-steady value with the increasing flag height. Compared with SC, the pressure drop of CCFF is always larger than that of SC, however, the mixing efficiency of CCFF is larger than that of SC only when Red or the flexible flag height is large enough. Comparing with CCRF, the pressure drop and mixing efficiency of CCFF are close to or smaller than those of CCRF at small and moderate Red, however, at large Red, CCFF has smaller pressure drop and larger mixing efficiency, and the maximum decrease of pressure drop could be up to 61.09% and the maximum increase of mixing efficiency could be up to 11.46% compared with CCRF.}

A variety of non-destructive techniques including synchrotron NEXAFS, XPS and ATR-FTIR for both non-grounded and grounded spent catalyst and its combustion residues were employed to reveal the speciation, spatial distribution of coke within the catalyst matrix, as well as its evolution upon rapid heart-up and combustion. As have been confirmed, the coke species is highly broad in speciation, covering aliphatic and aromatic compounds as well as graphite that are both physically deposited and chemically adsorbed on acid sites on the catalyst’s exterior surface. The majority of aliphatic hydrocarbons were also embedded deeply within the catalyst matrix, which were presumably caused by the penetration of precursor molecules that are small in size. Irrespective of the combustion mode, upon the initial rapid heat-up, the embedded light hydrocarbons were rapidly volatilised, and diffused outward toward the exterior surface, where it either underwent C-O2/C-CO2 reactions, or simply further recondensed into graphite in the case that oxygen is lean in the air-firing mode. In contrast, in the oxy-firing mode, the coke was confirmed highly reactive for reverse Boudouard reaction and methane drying reaction which were even triggered during the initial particle heat-up stage. Consequently, the initial graphitisation extent of light vapor was mitigated, and the micro-pores of catalysts were opened up to enable a continuous elution of the hydrocarbon vapors to boost the overall coke burn-off. Regarding the competition of the overall C-O2 and C-CO2 reactions on catalyst exterior surface, the former reaction is superior in the case where oxygen is lean (e.g. 3%). In contrast, when the oxygen content is higher (e.g. 10%), the latter one was intensified due to the strong heat feedback from the exothermic C-O2 reactions. As a result, the overall coke including other two species, graphite and aliphatic hydrocarbons were consumed quickly in the O2/CO2 case.}

The proposed non-ideal heterogeneous mixing models capture continuity (heat and mass conservation), yet are extremely simple with few parameters, so they lend themselves to fast online prediction (with extrapolation capabilities) and regular recalibration. Further, they are more accurate than computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (60% less error) and symbolic regression data-driven models (73% less error). Real-time high-resolution sensor data are collected for observing spatiotemporal responses of state variables (conductivity, pH, and temperature) to transient influent shocks. Deterministic global dynamic optimization is used for training and recalibration of the non-ideal heterogeneous mixing models to guarantee the best-possible fits to the sensor data. The models are then deployed within standard model-predictive control and two economic model-predictive control strategies to demonstrate model-based decision-making for disturbance rejection and optimal operation of aeration in a continuous flow nitrification system utilizing high-resolution sensor data from several spatial positions. The new technology platform, consisting of high-resolution sensors, non-ideal heterogeneous mixing modeling, deterministic global dynamic optimization, and model-predictive control, offers superior performance over current approaches in water and wastewater treatment processes.}

abstract = {Brine management is one of the global challenges nowadays. Herein, by taking advantage of capillary forces and low-grade heat (50 °C), we propose a novel ceramic membrane-promoted crystallization (MPC) process for brine management. The MPC process simplifies the traditional multiple energy-intensive steps and dispenses the use of expensive anticorrosive equipment via adopting three hierarchical layers (α-Al2O3 substrate, γ-Al2O3 interlayer, and SiO2 top layer). The hydrophilic mesoporous SiO2 top layer provides continuous driving force for brine solution transport from the inner shell of the membrane toward the outer surface, where heterogenous nucleation and secondary nucleation occur to form numerous long needle-like salt whiskers. The growth kinetics of salt whiskers accelerates with time as the formed salt whiskers provide extra evaporation area to intensify water evaporation. Template-directing molecules P123 significantly enhance the specific surface area, pore volume, pore size, and pore regularity of the SiO2 top layer, thereby promoting both water recovery and salt production. The optimized membrane displays high water recovery (790.3 g m−2) and salt production (194.6 g m−2) for high-salinity brine (20 wt%). Moreover, the MPC process demonstrates high performance, mechanical stability and thermal durability during the long-term test. It is expected that the MPC process would provide an innovative zero-liquid discharge approach for the efficient and low-cost brine management.}

Currently, most of the commercial cathodes are compounds rich of Li elements. In the initial operation of the as-assembled full cell, Li atoms are released from the cathode and directly deposited on the anode surface. The absence of the storage space in the conventional Li composite anode makes Li growth in an uncontrolled way and serious volume fluctuation of the electrode. Herein, LiF headspace affixed Li composite anode is prepared for the first time via a facile one-step thermal fusion method. The storage space constructed by LiF particles is formed on the top surface of 3D Li-LiZn-LiF (LZLF) composite anode, which can accommodate Li deposition from the cathode maintaining structural stability of the anode. Additionally, the LiF particles array on the surface can benefit for fast Li+ diffusion, suppressing Li dendrites growth and inducing uniform Li deposition. In a consequence, the LiF headspace affixed LZLF composite anode shows significantly improved electrochemical performance, i.e., more than 1000 h in symmetrical cell at 1 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2, or capacity retention of 88.9% after 800 cycles for the full cell at 1C with 2.45 mAh cm−2 in carbonate ester-based electrolyte.}

However, it is the first effort for a systematic comprehensive investigation and multi-objective optimization of gasification process for waste polymeric foams using response surface methodology and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution) approach. Air and steam waste rigid polyurethane foam gasifications were modeled using coupled method of Gibbs minimization free energy and Lagrange method of undetermined multipliers, and then, validated. Effects of key features consisting gasification temperature and moisture content in both air and steam gasification types and equivalence ratio in air and steam to waste foam ratio in steam types were thoroughly studied on gas composition and energy and hydrogen efficiencies. Analysis of variance was employed for recognizing the most effective parameters on air and steam gasification performances. The results revealed that hydrogen and energy efficiencies of air gasification at multi-objective optimum conditions were 42.68 % and 89.58 %, respectively, and these values were 64.02 % and 96.52 % for steam gasification type. Air gasification of waste rigid polyurethane foam produced 3.13 g of CO2 emission at optimum state; however, its value was 10.02 g for steam gasification type. A multi-criteria decision analysis based on TOPSIS method was utilized for selecting the best gasification type in different scenarios and the findings indicated that air gasification had better performance compared to steam type due to its low emissions.}

This report demonstrates that the eight methyl groups on cobalt phthalocyanine significantly improved its catalytic CO2 reduction performance. Theoretical computations confirmed that the non-peripheral octamethyl-substituted cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (N-CoMe2Pc) catalyst showed enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation on the Co surface at low overpotentials relative to pristine cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc). The N-CoMe2Pc nanorods and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NRGO) nanocomposites were successfully prepared by a facile, non-covalent immobilization strategy and their electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity was explored in both H-type and flow cell configurations. It was thus verified that immobilizing N-CoMe2Pc nanorods onto NRGO surfaces can lead to enhanced electroactivity and selectivity in terms of reducing CO2 to CO. Among the various tested nanocomposites, N-CoMe2Pc/NRGO with a catalyst: NRGO ratio of 6:10 showed superior CO faradaic efficiency/selectivity (90.0 %) and a total current density reaching 9.7 mA cm−2 at –0.8 V vs. RHE in an H-type cell containing a neutral electrolyte. A CO faradaic efficiency of 90.4% and a current density of 14.8 mA cm−2 were achieved at the same overpotential using a flow cell. The selectivity of this system was further improved to 94.1%, with an accompanying CO current density of 56.4 mA cm−2 and an impressive turnover frequency of 6.2 s−1 at lower potential (–0.6 V vs. RHE) in alkaline solution. This work provides new insights relevant for developing low-cost, effective, phthalocyanine-based catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction.}

The RACP emulsion was firstly prepared by soap-free emulsion polymerization between [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] trimethyl ammonium chloride (DMC) and methyl methacrylate (MMA), and then directly depositing onto porous substrate to form nanochannel selective layer of NF membrane. The optimal NF membrane shows a relatively large pore structure (i.e., cut-off pore size is 1.43 nm) and high pure water permeance (PWP) of 13.3 L·m−2·h−1·bar−1. Moreover, it shows a desirable rejection of basic amino acids and biopeptides (i.e., ∼95%) and allows neutral or acidic ones with similar molecule weight to permeate through. This work provides an innovative and facile method directly from RACP emulsion to construct NF membrane via nanoparticle packing, which greatly simplifies the preparation procedure for NF membrane. In addition, this novel NF membrane also demonstrates great potential in charge-based separation of biomolecules.}
