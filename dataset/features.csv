FARAG2022103647¡A human factors approach to evaluate predicators of acute care nurse occupational fatigue¡Occupational fatigue= Nurses= Shift-work¡Nurses function at the point of care and assume a significant role in intercepting errors. They work in a mentally and physically demanding profession that is comprised of shift-work, subjecting nurses to considerable fatigue. Yet, few studies constructed a comprehensive model that integrates personal and occupational factors to explore their relationship with various types of fatigue (acute, chronic, physical, mental, and total). Here, we examine this type of comprehensive fatigue-model, in a report that represents one aim of a larger, mixed-methods study. The study sample comprised of 1137 registered nurses working in eight hospitals in a Midwestern state. Nurses reported higher levels of acute and total fatigue than chronic and physical fatigue. Staffing and resource adequacy, exercise, and sleep were among the strongest predictors. Since fatigue is a multi-faceted construct, a comprehensive fatigue-management strategy that targets both day and night-shift nurses is the optimal way to manage nurse fatigue.
JUNG2022103649¡Usability enhancement based on usability heuristics: An examination of the underlying mechanism utilizing the psychological–refractory–period paradigm¡Usability heuristics= Interface design= User–interface (UI) design= Psychological–refractory–period paradigm¡User Interface (UI) design practices often abide by popular usability heuristics such as Nielsen’s (1994) “10 usability heuristics for user interface design” or Gerhardt–Powals' (1996) cognitive engineering principles. To examine the underlying mechanism of user performance enhancement by following some of these usability heuristics, we compared user performance between two device conditions: one representing design practices following two selected sets of usability heuristics (experimental condition) and the other without following them (control condition). As a research framework, we adopted the psychological–refractory–period (PRP) paradigm along with the locus–of–slack logic, a well–established dual–task paradigm for examining the nature of cognitive benefits caused by experimental manipulations. Results showed that the experimental–device condition that followed the usability heuristics yielded faster performance than the control condition, especially when the stimulus–onset–asynchrony between the two tasks was long than when it was short. According to the locus–of–slack logic, these results suggest that the nature of cognitive benefits caused by following the usability heuristics is more likely to be due to shortening of the response–activation stage (rather than the response–selection stage). These findings suggest that following the two usability heuristics tends to facilitate a specific stage of the information processes more than other stages.
ELPRAMA2022103615¡An industrial exoskeleton user acceptance framework based on a literature review of empirical studies¡Acceptance= Industrial exoskeletons= Use= Usage= Comfort= Technology acceptance= Discomfort¡1 Abstract Studying the acceptance of exoskeletons in industry has gained increased attention. Exoskeletons (wearable support devices) are envisioned to alleviate heavy work. Examining what factors influence the use of exoskeletons is important, because influencing these factors could positively contribute to the adoption of industrial exoskeletons. The factors identified in this paper have been systematically derived from empirical research with (potential future) end users, most of whom have tried on an exoskeleton. Our framework with factors influencing the acceptance of industrial exoskeletons can be used during the (ideally iterative) design, (re)development and evaluation phase of new or existing exoskeletons. This could improve the quality of exoskeletons since this allows designers to already consider acceptance factors early in the design process instead of finding out what is important late in the design process during (field) testing. In turn, this might accelerate the adoption of exoskeletons. Also, our framework can be used to study the ongoing introduction of exoskeletons at work since it also addresses policy decisions companies interested in implementing exoskeletons should consider.
OAKMAN2022103614¡Workplace physical and psychosocial hazards: A systematic review of evidence informed hazard identification tools¡Hazards= Risk assessment= Musculoskeletal disorders= Ergonomics¡Prevention of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) requires the identification of physical and psychosocial hazards. This systematic review aimed to identify accessible and validated tools, for the assessment of workplace physical and psychosocial hazards, and consolidate the results into a matrix for use by work health and safety (WHS) professionals. Web of Science, Medline, ProQuest Central, and PsychInfo electronic databases, along with grey literature, were searched (Jan 1990 to July 2020). Studies that included tools with evidence of validity for the identification of physical hazards, psychosocial hazards, or both were included. A total of 83 tools were identified and then reviewed to ensure the tools were accessible. The final matrix included a total of 26 tools (16 physical, 4 psychosocial, and 6 comprehensive [physical and psychosocial]). Evidence on best practice for MSD mitigation supports the need for a comprehensive approach; however, the current review identified limitations in the availability of such tools to support WHS professionals.
TETTEH2022103646¡Effects of passive exoskeleton support on EMG measures of the neck, shoulder and trunk muscles while holding simulated surgical postures and performing a simulated surgical procedure¡sEMG= Musculoskeletal disorders¡Exoskeletons have shown significant impact at reducing the biomechanical demand on muscles during repetitive lifting and overhead tasks in non-healthcare industries. However, the benefits of exoskeletons are yet to be realized in the operating room, particularly as work-related musculoskeletal disorders continue to be a concern for surgeons. This study quantified the effect of using neck, arm, and trunk exoskeletons on muscle activity while assuming typical postures held in the operating room. Fourteen participants were recruited to participate in this study. In this two-part experiment participants were asked to 1) hold a series of neck flexion, arm abduction and trunk flexion postures seen in surgical procedures, and 2) perform a simulated surgical task requiring five different trunk flexion posture levels. Participants were required to complete these tasks with and without passive exoskeleton(s). This study showed that even for postures held short time periods, exoskeletons are beneficial at reducing the demand on muscles; however, the reduction in muscle demand depends on body segment and postural angle, as intended with these passive exoskeletons. Furthermore, for the simulated surgical task with awkward trunk flexion postures (10–65°), the trunk exoskeletons showed a significant reduction in the rate of rise in back muscle sEMG (+1.365%MVC/min vs. +0.769%MVC/min for non-dominant lumbar extensor muscles, p = 0.0108; +1.377%MVC/min vs. +0.770%MVC/min for the dominant lumbar extensor muscles, p = 0.0196) over 25 min, consequently resulting in improved trunk subjective discomfort scores (7.34 vs. 4.30, p < 0.05), with no impact on the neck and shoulder biomechanical demand. The results from this study indicate that exoskeletons may be a potential intervention to reduce biomechanical loading during surgery.
WINBERG2022103661¡Anti-fatigue mats can reduce low back discomfort in transient pain developers¡Anti-fatigue mats= Low back pain¡Complaints of musculoskeletal pain are common among employees who stand for prolonged periods. This study sought to determine if an anti-fatigue mat (AFM) could uniquely affect low back pain (LBP), low back posture, and foot-floor interface responses in individuals prone to developing LBP (termed pain developers (PDs)) during prolonged standing experiments compared to those who do not develop LBP under the same exposures (termed non pain developers (NPDs)). Sixteen volunteers (8 PDs and 8 NPDs) were recruited based on their pain-development tendencies, which were established in previous standing experiments. They visited the laboratory on two separate days for 60 min of light manual work while standing on either a rigid floor or AFM. All participants were asymptomatic at the beginning of each experimental session. The amount of LBP experienced during the standing exposure, measured via a visual analogue scale, was reduced (p = 0.03) in the PD group when on the AFM (3.6 ± 6 mm) compared to the rigid floor (6.8 ± 7 mm). LBP levels remained low and unchanged (p = 0.5) between the AFM (2.4 ± 5 mm) and rigid floor (1.6 ± 2 mm) conditions for the NPD group. Neither postural nor foot-floor interface measures correlated with this unique reduction of LBP for the PD group when standing on the AFM. The AFM did, however, increase centre of pressure excursion (NPD 55% increase; PD 35% increase) and tended to increase the number of body weight shifts (NPD 116% increase; PD 54% increase) in both the PD and NPD groups. These findings suggest that AFMs may selectively benefit individuals prone to developing standing-induced back pain by facilitating subtle movements at the foot-floor interface.
MCLEAN2022103651¡Evaluation of a systems ergonomics-based incident reporting system¡RE-AIM= Led outdoor activity= Incident reporting= Systems analysis¡Introduction Incident reporting and learning systems are a fundamental component of safety management. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel incident reporting system specific to the Australian Led Outdoor Activity (LOA) sector. The Understanding and Preventing Led Outdoor Accidents Data System (UPLOADS), is a recently introduced systems thinking-based incident reporting and learning system that utilises contemporary safety theory and methods. Method The implementation of UPLOADS was evaluated using the RE-AIM framework based on the following dimensions: Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance. A pragmatic evaluation approach was used in which evaluation data were collected through the triangulation of multiple sources including different LOA stakeholders from both the individual organisational level (LOA providers) and LOA sector governance level (LOA industry representatives), incident data collected through the UPLOADS National Incident Dataset, and the online and physical presence of UPLOADS. Results The findings show that a key strength of UPLOADS is its effectiveness as incident reporting tool for improving safety in the LOA sector. However, a weakness of UPLOADS is that it is not being implemented appropriately by the LOA providers. Conclusion Overall, the current findings suggest that UPLOADS incident reporting tool is perceived by SMEs as an effective tool for improving safety in LOA. However, further work is required for UPLOADS to have a greater impact on the LOA sector. Specifically, Implementation of the UPLOADS system requires improvement, as well as additional training and education may be required to upskill and empower LOA providers to improve reporting and enhance the value placed on safety by LOA stakeholders. The RE-AIM framework was an appropriate evaluation framework for understanding the effectiveness of UPLOADS as a LOA sector specific incident reporting and learning system. Practical applications The current findings have practical implications for ergonomics researchers applying evaluation frameworks in the real world, and LOA providers for implementing safety interventions. Lastly, contemporary systems-based incident reporting and learning systems have the capability to enhance the safety practices of the LOA sector.
HAMIM2022103650¡Taking a mixed-methods approach to collision investigation: AcciMap, STAMP-CAST and PCM¡Accimap= STAMP-CAST¡Recently, ergonomics and safety researchers have turned their attention towards applying combinations of sociotechnical methods rather than using single methods in isolation. In the current research, a mixed-method approach combining two systems-based methods, Accimaps and the Systems Theoretic Accident Model and Process - Causal Analysis using Systems Theory (STAMP-CAST), and one cognitive approach, the Perceptual Cycle Model (PCM), were employed in analysing a rail-level crossing incident in Bangladesh. Each method was applied individually to investigate the collision, and interventions were proposed corresponding to incident events at different risk management framework levels. The three methods provided different perspectives of the whole picture, together identifying an array of contributory factors. The complementary nature of these methods aided in proposing a comprehensive set of safety recommendations, thereby demonstrating the benefit of a mixed-method approach for collision investigation in low-income settings.
LI2022133013¡Boosting low-temperature water gas shift reaction over Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst activated by oxygen plasma¡Plasma treatment= Au nanocatalysts= WGS reaction¡The efficient removal of carbon monoxide (CO) from H2-rich stream via the water gas shift (WGS) reaction requires the catalysts that possess high activity at low temperatures to avoid the thermodynamic equilibrium limitation. We report that oxygen (O2) plasma activation enables an Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst to achieve superior activity in the WGS reaction at low temperatures. At 120 °C, O2 plasma activated Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst exhibits CO reaction rate of 0.51 mmol·mg−1·h−1, which is 5 times higher than the conventional activated counterpart. CO conversion over O2 plasma activated Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst only slightly decreases from 73% to 68% during a 4.5 h continuous WGS reaction at 150 °C. The catalyst characterizations indicate that O2 plasma activation could control average size of Au nanoparticles below 3.5 nm, create plenty of coordinatively unsaturated sites (on Au nanoparticles) and sufficient Auδ+-Oδ--Ti sites (at interfaces between Au and TiO2), and modulate the electronic structure of interfaces, which accelerates greatly the WGS reaction. Further, the enhancement mechanism of the WGS reaction over O2 plasma activated Au/TiO2 nanocatalyst was disclosed.
JING2022133034¡Regulation of electron depletion layer in polymer-based nanocomposites for superior energy storage capability¡Breakdown strength= Electron depletion layer= Heterojunction region= Energy storage¡Polymer-based dielectrics trigger great interests in advanced electric systems due to their high breakdown strength and power density. However, a major drawback is that excessive addition of high-εr ceramic nanofillers may deteriorate their breakdown strength and further reduce energy density. Herein, a general strategy is provided to dramatically enhance the breakdown strength by introducing a small amount of core–shell structured Al2O3@BiFeO3 nanofibers into PVDF/PMMA polymer matrix. The thickness of BiFeO3 shell is regulated by controlling its molar concentration. A significantly enhanced breakdown strength (759 kV mm−1) and an ultrahigh energy density (22.7 J cm−3) with an energy efficiency of 72% are observed. The greatly improved breakdown strength is ascribed to the regulation of electron depletion layer. When the width of heterojunction region gradually approaches to the scale of electron depletion layer, more annihilation of electrons happens and thus contributes to the enhancement of the breakdown strength. The results suggest that our designed structure can help to address the issue of both enhancing the breakdown strength and energy density for diverse nanocomposites over a broad application.
MA2022132989¡Lightweight, elastic and superhydrophobic multifunctional nanofibrous aerogel for self-cleaning, oil/water separation and pressure sensing¡Conductive= Superhydrophobic nanofibrous aerogel= Self-cleaning= Oil/water separation¡Developing a durable, lightweight, and robust aerogel with multifunctional characteristics is greatly desirable but remains challenging these days. Herein, an environment-friendly and original nanofibrous aerogel with integrative performance was constructed through the combination of nanofibrous aerogels’ forming technique and post-treatment modification approach. The obtained aerogel has a hierarchical porous structure consisting of flexible polyacrylonitrile nanofibers (PANF), a functional polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) polymer, conductive carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and hydrophobic octadecylamine functionalized reduced graphene oxide (ODA-rGO), endowing it with ultralow density (20.54 mg cm−3), superior compressibility and recoverability, outstanding fatigue resistance over 1000 cycles. The hydrophobic ODA-rGO coating imparts the hydrophilic PANF/CNT aerogel superhydrophobicity (154°), contributing to a splendid self-cleaning ability. Additionally, the aerogel was capable of realizing excellent oil/water separation performances. Both organic solvents and soybean oil could be adsorbed by the aerogel with high adsorption capacity (36.07 to 65.09 g g−1) and good stable in recycling as a result of its hierarchical porous structure and good hydrophobicity. It was noteworthy that the aerogel composite can be used as a piezoresistive sensor, exhibiting high sensitivity (33 kPa−1 in the range of 0–2 kPa), low detection limit (1% strain), fast response (160 ms), and good durability (over 1000 cycles). Further, it was demonstrated that the composite can be used to monitor various human activities in real time. These advantages make it an excellent candidate for smart garments, high-efficient oil/water separation and human motion detection.
REN2022132977¡Optimized orbital occupancy of transition metal in spinel Ni-Co oxides with heteroatom doping for Aprotic Li-O2 battery¡Li-O battery= Oxygen electrode= Electrocatalyst= Ni-Co oxide¡Li-O2 battery is one of the most attractive energy storage technologies because of its extremely high energy density (3500 Wh kg−1). However, the main limitation of the battery is the high energy barrier during the formation and decomposition of the discharge product (Li2O2), which results in a series of problems such as large overpotential and poor cycle stability. Herein, the Fe-doped spinel Ni-Co oxides are employed as the cathode catalyst to decrease the energy barrier of the oxygen electrode reactions in Li-O2 battery. The batteries with Fe-doped Ni-Co oxides deliver a large discharge specific capacity of 16,727 mAh g−1 and remarkable durability of over 790 h at current density of 500 mA g−1. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the optimized performance is attributed to the near-unity eg electron occupancy (1.32) in transition metal atom for iron-doped Ni-Co oxide as compared to that for undoped Ni-Co oxide (1.64). The near-unity eg electron occupancy can increase the covalency of transition metal-oxygen bonds and finally enhance the electrocatalytic activity. This study is helpful for deeply understanding the relationship between the surface electronic structure and catalytic activity of oxygen electrocatalysts in Li-O2 cells.
CHEN2022133005¡Pruney fingers-inspired highly stretchable and sensitive piezoresistive fibers with isotropic wrinkles and robust interfaces¡Pruney fibers=  polymerization= Isotropic wrinkles= Robust interfaces¡Scalable construction of robust and isotropic wrinkles on fiber surface is crucial for the development of highly sensitive piezoresistive fibers, which still remains a challenge. Herein, inspired by the typical morphology and formation of pruney fingers, we develop a novel core–shell “pruney fiber” with both isotropic wrinkles and robust interfaces via a scalable and facile fabrication strategy. Briefly, the robust isotropic wrinkles are constructed through the core thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) molecular chain’s constriction and the sheath pyrrole monomer’ synergistic interfacial polymerization. As a result, the robust interfaces enable the pruney fiber high stabilities under a remark stretchability (200%). Two as-prepared pruney fibers are overlapped vertically for piezoresistive sensing. Owe to the interlocking of the surface isotropic wrinkles, the piezoresistive fibers show high sensitivity (0.15 kPa−1), fast response time (47 ms), low detection limit (0.2 g), and high stability. For practical applications, the piezoresistive fibers can be easily weaved and integrated into a smart glove for wearable sensors and human–machine interfaces (HMI). At last, the novel structure and its unique scalable developing process would pave a new way in stable surface structure engineering on variable surface in the future.
GAO2022132949¡Superstructure silver micro-tube composites for ultrahigh electromagnetic wave shielding¡Electromagnetic interference shielding= Electroless plating= Silver micro-tubes= Silver nanoparticle= Poly(lactic acid)¡Absorption-dominant electromagnetic shielding materials can effectively reduce secondary pollution in the shielding process, and have greater significance in practical applications. Herein, silver (Ag) micro-tubes with superstructure, which were fabricated via using poly(lactic acid) (PLA) fibers as templates, were used to achieve the composites with ultrahigh, lightweight, and absorption-dominant electromagnetic shielding performance. The Ag nanoparticles were firstly deposited on the surface of PLA fibers by chemical reduction. The Ag micro-tubes were obtained by etching the PLA fibers in the core. The Ag nanoparticles were stuck together to form the Ag micro-tubes by polymer chains. The ultrahigh electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding effectiveness (SE) of ∼110 dB was found in the Ag micro-tubes composed with polydimethylsiloxane or PLA with 1.5 mm in thickness. Due to the micro-tube structure, the composites containing with Ag micro-tubes exhibited absorption dominant shielding mechanism and low density. The absorption coefficient (A) value could reach 0.79 in the composites with Ag micro-tubes. The ultrahigh EMI SE performance and absorption dominant shielding mechanism of the composites was ascribed to the superstructure of the Ag micro-tubes which could efficiently create surface plasmon resonance, electronic vibration, interfacial polarization, capacitance effect and conductive loss. The work provides a new idea for preparing ultrahigh electromagnetic shielding materials with high absorption and low density.
TANG2022132973¡Microstructure design and construction of anti-wetting and anti-fouling multifunctional Janus membrane for robust membrane distillation¡Membrane distillation= Janus membrane= Membrane structure= Electrospray= Anti-fouling¡Membrane wetting and fouling were main restrictions for the industrial application of membrane distillation (MD), especially in the presence of surfactants or oily substances. Herein, a novel anti-wetting and anti-fouling multifunctional Janus membrane was designed by optimization of the size of reentrant structure and position of hydrophilic layer. The theoretical relationships between wettability and the microstructure of the Janus membrane was derived mathematically. A facile approach was applied for the dual-layer bioinspired membrane fabrication by a two-step electrospray strategy. The resultant composite structure presented high omniphobicity (water contact angle of omniphobic sub-surface was 159.3 ± 1.1°) and underwater superoleophobicity (underwater oil contact angle of hydrophilic top surface was 152.7 ± 0.5°). Meanwhile, the wettability of the fabricated Janus membrane kept robust in a broad pH range of 1–14. During continuous MD treatment for emulsified oily hypersaline solution, the Janus membrane exhibited stable permeate flux and salt rejection (around 100%). It was speculated that the hydration effect of hydrophilic top layer coupled with the cavitation and slip boundary effects of the reentrant structure might be the key reasons for the robust anti-wetting and anti-fouling performances. Significantly, this novel bioinspired Janus membrane was believed as a candidate for treating challenging wastewaters such as the shale oils produced-water, and also had high potential in paving the way for industrial application of MD.
JANCZAREK2022132062¡Progress of functionalized TiO2-based nanomaterials in the construction industry: A comprehensive review¡Nanotechnology= Engineering materials= Titania= Titania-based nanomaterials¡The intensive development of construction in recent years and the increasing demands on the durability and service life of buildings have increasingly caused construction scientists to pay attention to new material solutions based on nanotechnology. One of these solutions is the use of titanium dioxide, with its photocatalytic and antibacterial properties, in building materials. Although this solution has been known for decades, there are few articles that review the latest trends in this area. Compared with other literature studies, this article pays particular attention to the possibility of modifying nanotitania to expand its photocatalytic properties, and analyzes the effects of these alterations on the self-cleaning, air-depolluting and antibacterial properties of building materials, mainly cement-based composites. It is complemented by a section dedicated to the mechanical and durability properties of pristine and functionalized TiO2-modified building materials, taking into account dispersion methods, rheological and mechanical parameters, as well as resistance to external factors.
WANG2022133015¡BiOI nanosheets-wrapped carbon fibers as efficient electrocatalyst for bidirectional polysulfide conversion in Li–S batteries¡Polysulfides= Composite= Electrocatalysis= Lithium-sulfur batteries¡The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries involve intricate electrochemical processes containing the formation and conversion of polysulfides, in which the shuttle effect and slow reaction kinetics impair its practical performance. Exploring new electrocatalyst with strong catalytic ability can greatly accelerate the conversion of polysulfides in Li-S batteries. Herein, BiOI/carbon fibers (BiOI/CFs) core–shell composite has been prepared by a facile electrospinning combined with solvothermal method and used as a promising electrocatalyst. The BiOI nanosheets are cross-linked to form a porous three-dimensional network on the surface of carbon fibers. This architecture not only has the advantage of large aspect ratio, but also has a high specific surface area, which provides abundant active sites and ensures high electron/ion transfer for the electrocatalysis of lithium polysulfides. As expected, BiOI/CFs electrode presents a superior bidirectional oxidation–reduction ability for polysulfides. The first-principles calculations also prove the strong interaction between BiOI and polysulfides. Due to these advantages, BiOI/CFs can effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides, and possesses excellent electrochemical performance in Li-S batteries. The specific capacity of the BiOI/CFs-S electrode is stable at 1020 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 0.2C and 598 mAh g−1 after 1000 cycles at 5C. This work provides new insights for the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for polysulfide conversion.
REDDY2022132988¡Novel edge-capped ZrO2 nanoparticles onto V2O5 nanowires for efficient photosensitized reduction of chromium (Cr (VI)), photoelectrochemical solar water splitting, and electrochemical energy storage applications¡ZrO nanoparticles= VO nanowires= Heterostructured photocatalysts= Photocatalysis= Photoelectrochemical water splitting= Energy storage supercapacitors¡Novel edge-capped ZrO2 nanoparticles on V2O5 nanowires were successfully synthesized through a simple, eco-friendly, and inexpensive hydrothermal technique. The as-prepared nanostructures were characterized using various measurements to study their structural, morphological, optical, and surface properties. Furthermore, photoelectrochemical water oxidation, photocatalytic performance for Cr(VI) reduction, and electrochemical energy storage were studied. The surface morphology analysis revealed the edge-capped ZrO2 nanoparticles on the V2O5 nanowires. The optical analysis showed that the heterostructure formation between ZrO2 and V2O5 could tune the bandgap (2.05 eV) of the composite. Due to the improved separation efficacy of the photoexcited charge carriers and greater surface area, compared to the pure materials, the ZrO2/V2O5 (ZV) composite displayed considerable improvement in photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction performance, as well as excellent reusability performance (70.5 % after 4 cycles), thus facilitating its wastewater treatment. The ZV electrode displayed approximately 1.6- and 5.8-fold improvement in specific capacitance over the ZrO2 and V2O5 electrodes, respectively. Furthermore, the ZV electrode exhibited the lowest charge resistance under light illumination conditions. From the linear sweep voltammetry curve analysis, the ZV electrode possessed an improved photocurrent density (5.363 mA cm−2), demonstrating approximately 33- and 3.5-times improvement in photocurrent density over the pristine electrodes.
JI2022132960¡Highly efficient and selective Hg(II) removal from water by thiol-functionalized MOF-808: Kinetic and mechanism study¡MOF-808-SH= Hg(II) removal= High adsorption capacity= Ultrafast adsorption kinetics¡Mercury pollution poses a serious threat to the ecological environment and public health due to its high toxicity and persistence, but there is still a lack of rapid and effective Hg(II) removal technology, especially emergency response of Hg(II) leakage. Herein, an effective metal-organic framework adsorbent, MOF-808-SH, was fabricated by grafting thioglycollic acid on MOF-808 for Hg(II) removal. The MOF-808-SH demonstrated high adsorption capacity of 977.5 mg/g, impressively ultrafast adsorption kinetics (C0 = 10 mg/L, removal > 99 % in 10 s) with a rate constant k of 36.89 g mg−1 min−1, which is dozens of times faster than that of ever reported Hg(II) adsorbents. Batch experiments show that MOF-808-SH exhibits high selectivity toward Hg(II) with a distribution coefficient Kd as high as 5.0×106 mL/g. Moreover, MOF-808-SH exhibits excellent recyclability with a negligible loss of capacity after 6 adsorption-regeneration cycles. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) unveil that the –SH groups in MOF-808-SH are the key adsorption sites, and specific inner-sphere coordination with Hg(II) is responsible for the high selectivity. In addition, large surface area, well-developed porous structures and high –SH loading of MOF-808-SH reasonably explains ultrafast kinetics and high adsorption capacity for Hg(II). This study indicates the potential of MOF-808-SH to remove Hg(II) from wastewater.
ZUO2022133004¡A directional Built-in electric field mediates the electron transfer synergy mechanism of the Radical/Nonradical pathway in FeOCl-CuO¡Directional built-in electric field= Electron transfer synergy mechanism= Radical= Nonradical¡Synergistic free radical/nonradical oxidation can effectively degrade toxic organic pollutants in complex aqueous environments, but a synergistic electron transfer mechanism has not been developed. In this study, a directional built-in electric field was established in FeOCl-CuO for the first time that can synergistically transfer free radical and nonfree radical electrons. The directional built-in electric field provides electron transfer channels, CuO oxidizes peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to produce 1O2 and gains electrons, electrons are transferred to FeOCl through the directional built-in electric field, and FeOCl catalyzes PMS to produce ·OH and SO4·- and loses electrons. Thus, reactive oxygen species are rapidly produced, and toxic organic pollutants are synergistically oxidatively degraded. This directional built-in electric field-mediated radical/nonradical synergistic mechanism can achieve electron synergy and overcome the electron gain/loss limitation of radical or nonradical reactions, which results in an efficient, sustained and stable catalytic degradation of toxic organic pollutants (kinetic reaction rate constant is increased 38.3 times). Pollutants could be stably removed in pilot devices. The developed kinetic model successfully predicted the kinetic reaction rate constants under different conditions. Theoretical calculations and toxicity assessment revealed that this synergistic radical/nonradical oxidation pathway can effectively degrade bisphenol A (BPA) into less toxic or harmless small molecules and capture carbon in an alkaline environment to reduce carbon emissions. This study provides new insights into the efficient, sustained, and low-carbon treatment of toxic organic wastewater by synergistic radical/nonradical oxidation in complex aqueous environments.
TANG2022133023¡CNT boosted two-dimensional flaky metal-organic nanosheets for superior lithium and potassium storage¡Flaky nanosheet= Carbon nanotubes= Lithium-ion batteries= Potassium-ion batteries¡Flaky nanosheets with superior molecular structures and functions are indispensable for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). Herein, through a simple dispersion method, two-dimensional Co-MOF-CNT nanosheets are prepared by adding nanotubes (CNT) during the synthesis of MOF under microwave-assisted radiation conditions. The flaky dispersed sheet structure possesses more exposed surfaces and porous structures for Co-MOF-CNT, which is beneficial to offering numerous active sites and promoting the rapid transmission of Li/K-ions. Therefore, when applied as negative electrode for LIB and PIB, the Co-MOF-CNT nanosheets can provide an extremely enhanced reversible capacity (1451/286 mAh g−1 for LIBs/PIBs after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1). In view of ex-situ XPS result, in-situ FTIR result and electrochemical detection, the excellent electrochemical performance is determined due to the activated lithium-reaction involving metal centers, CO groups and CC groups from benzene rings. The research on lithium/potassium reaction functional groups of MOF nanosheets with more activated energy-storage sites would further provide guidance for the exploration on superior-performance electrodes for future alkali metal secondary batteries.
OU2022132925¡Encapsulating subnanometric metal clusters in zeolites for catalysis and their challenges¡Subnanometric metal clusters= Zeolites= Catalysis= Encapsulation= Synthesis= Stability¡Subnanometric metal clusters encapsulated within zeolites are of great interests for the industrial catalysis. Herein we review for the first time the encapsulation of subnanometric metal clusters in zeolites. The concepts of both subnanometric metal clusters and zeolites are briefly introduced. The recent advancements of synthesis methods, such as impregnation, ion-exchange followed by post-treatment, template-guidance approach, in situ hydrothermal synthesis and interzeolite transformation are summarized. Further, the encapsulation effects including metal loading, ligand property, zeolite type and calcination condition for subdividing subnanometric metal clusters and nanoparticles in zeolites using quite similar synthesis procedures during in situ hydrothermal synthesis are firstly reviewed to explore the underlying mechanism. The important catalytic applications mainly contained propane dehydrogenation, formic acid decomposition, ammonia borane hydrolysis, cyclohexane oxidation, water–gas shift reaction and hydrogenation reaction are demonstrated. This review concludes with the challenges and status of both the stability issue under high temperature and advanced characterization techniques as well as the industrial perspectives.
PHAM2022132948¡Acylamino-functionalized crosslinker to synthesize all-solid-state polymer electrolytes for high-stability lithium batteries¡Urethane linkage= Crosslinker= Solid polymer electrolyte= Lithiophilicity¡All-solid-state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are key for improving lithium-ion battery (LIB) safety and the practical application of metallic Li anodes. The major challenges of developing SPEs are their ionic conductivity, interfacial affinity, and flammability. In this article, synthesis of an SPE comprising lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and poly(ethylene oxide) networked with an acylamino-functionalized crosslinker is reported. The acylamino sites, urethane and biuret linkages, dissociate LiTFSI and may form deep-eutectic-solvent domains to facilitate ion transport. This SPE is fire-retarding because CO2 evolves when the urethane decomposes at high temperatures. When operated at room temperature, the all-solid-state Li|SPE|LiFePO4 cell exhibits a high rate capability and long lifespan. Due to the high elasticity of the SPE, the polymers can self-rearrange during operation to reduce the Li–SPE interfacial resistance and regulate Li+-ion transport for uniform Li deposition. The rearrangement may involve migration of the low-energy alkane chains in the crosslinker toward the Li-anode, resulting in overspreading of lithiophilic carbonyl groups and F-atoms of TFSI− at the interface. This rearrangement property enables the SPE to act as an artificial interlayer in liquid-electrolyte LIBs. The advantages of using an acylamino-functionalized crosslinker to synthesize a networked SPE for high ionic conductivity and interfacial compatibility are demonstrated.
CHEN2022132972¡Roles of biochar in cement-based stabilization/solidification of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash¡Engineered biochar= Carbon neutrality= Metal/metalloid leachability= Waste incineration fly ash= Hazardous waste treatment¡Low-carbon stabilization/solidification (S/S) is of increasing importance for sustainable treatment of hazardous wastes. In this study, we integrated carbon-negative rice husk biochar (RBC) and yard waste biochar (YBC) as green additives into the binder for S/S of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) fly ash. Experimental results illustrated that the addition of both biochars promoted cement hydration reaction via pozzolanic reaction and internal curing. In particular, the incorporation of 10 wt% RBC (rich in activated Si) significantly increased the content of C-S-H gel from 41.6 wt% (control sample) to 52.0 wt% and increased the average degree of connectivity of C-S-H gel from 1.43 to 1.52 as indicated by quantitative X-ray diffraction and 29Si nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. The incorporation of RBC and YBC (20 or 30 wt%) enhanced the immobilization efficiency of potentially toxic elements in MSWI fly ash due to the additional hydration products and high adsorption ability of biochar. For instance, in R-80FA and Y-80FA samples (namely, 20 wt% binder dosage, of which RBC or YBC accounted for 10 wt% of binder), the immobilization efficiency for Pb could reach 96.2% and comply with the leachability limit. The biochar-modified S/S blocks achieved comparable strength to the cement-based S/S blocks, presenting a mechanically stable solidified matrix for engineering application. Therefore, this study expands the emerging application of biochar and demonstrates that biochar-augmented binder can ensure low-carbon and high-performance S/S of hazardous materials.
QIN2022133045¡High area energy density of all-solid-state supercapacitor based on double-network hydrogel with high content of graphene/PANI fiber¡High content= Double-network hydrogel= 3D Printing¡In order to improve the energy and power density of all-solid-state supercapacitor, more attention is currently focused on the development of electrodes and electrolyte materials with various chemical structure and compositions. However, current studies rarely report hydrogel electrodes with high content of active materials (i.e. > 20.0 wt%), and study their influence on the performance of supercapacitors. Here, a double-network hydrogel electrode was developed and prepared by blade-coating and 3D printing for application in all-solid-state supercapacitor. Moreover, the hydrogel electrode has an unusually high content (25.0 wt%) of active material, leading to high area specific capacitance (871.4mF/cm2) and area energy density (0.14 mWh/cm2 at 0.27 mW/cm2.). This study opens a new pathway to develop high-performance all-solid-state supercapacitors on large-scale.
CHU2022132994¡Schottky junction and multiheterostructure synergistically enhance rate performance and cycling stability¡Schottky junction= Multiheterostructure= Potassium-ion batteries= Anode¡Constructing Schottky junction and multiheterostructure is considered a promising modification strategy to enhance reaction kinetics and prolong cycle life for alkali ion batteries, especially for potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) with sluggish kinetics and huge volume expansion. Herein, a well-designed multiheterostructure of SnS@C@MoS2@NC micronflower is successfully synthesized, which consists of SnS, intermediate carbon, MoS2 and N-doped carbon from interior to exterior. The Schottky junction with built-in electric-field induced by phase boundaries and the double carbon layers (intermediate carbon and N-doped carbon coating layer) significantly improve the electrons transfer rate, and simultaneously the multiheterostructure affords rapid K+ diffusion, strong K absorption and boosted electronic conductivity, resulting in superior charge transfer kinetics, which is explicitly unraveled by experimental results and first-principles calculations. Moreover, this multilayered structure with double carbon layers can effectively buffer the volumetric variation and maintain structural stability. Benefiting from these merits, the SnS@C@MoS2@NC anode delivers remarkable reversible capacity (471 mAh g−1 at 50 mA g−1 after 100 cycles), outstanding rate performance (305 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1) and ultralong lifespan (253 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 after 3000 cycles) for KIBs. This work sheds a light on fabricating advanced electrodes by utilizing the Schottky junction and multiheterostructure.
CHATZILIAS2022132967¡Kinetic study of CO2 hydrogenation on Ru/ YSZ catalyst using a monolithic electropromoted reactor (MEPR)¡EPOC= CO hydrogenation= Kinetic study¡The majority of the kinetic studies reported in the literature for heterogeneously catalyzed reactions, take place on laboratory scale reactors. In the present study, the kinetic mechanism of electrochemical promotion of CO2 hydrogenation was investigated using a scaled up, monolithic electropromoted reactor (MEPR) loaded with nine parallelly connected Ru/YSZ/Au electrochemical cells. The study was carried out under atmospheric pressure, at 370 °C, with a flowrate of 1000 cm3/min and over a wide range of reactants partial pressures. The morphological and electronic characteristics of the catalyst surface, before and after reaction, were thoroughly investigated with a variety of techniques including X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD). It was shown that increasing the partial pressure of H2 (electron donor) leads to an increase in the methane production rate with a concurrent decrease of CO formation. Methanation emerges with a positive order in H2 whereas the RWGS with a negative one. Increasing the partial pressure of electron acceptor (CO2) leads to the opposite behavior. Based on the kinetic results and the rules of chemical and electrochemical promotion, an electrophobic behavior (increase of the rate with increasing catalyst potential) is expected for the methanation reaction and an electrophilic (decrease of the rate with increasing catalyst potential) for the RWGS reaction. Both predictions are confirmed experimentally. The results are in agreement with previous studies on CO2 hydrogenation in laboratory scale reactors demonstrating the successful design and operation of the current scaled up electropromoted system (MEPR).
XIAO2022133019¡Highly charged hydrogel with enhanced donnan exclusion toward ammonium for efficient solar-driven water remediation¡Solar evaporation= Ammonium rejection= Charged hydrogel= Water vapor generation¡Developing solar-driven photothermal materials with superior rejection capability toward volatile ammonium (NH4+) is a huge challenge but rather important for agricultural/municipal wastewater remediation. Herein, different from common hierarchical porosity designs, a positive charge-assisted Janus hydrogel evaporator with enhanced Donnan exclusion toward ammonium is uniquely achieved without sacrificing the water evaporation capability. The ammonium diffusion resistance of the so-fabricated Janus evaporator is significantly increased by optimizing the charge density and diffusion distance, yielding a high ammonium rejection rate up to 95%, which is never reported before. Meanwhile, the Janus evaporator also yields a water evaporation rate up to 3.3 kg m−2h−1 for the natural wastewater via partial amorphization of cellulose Iα allomorph, which is ∼3 times faster than the previous photothermal materials for intercepting volatile phenol molecules. This work points out new avenues for the application of photothermal materials in separating freshwater from small volatile molecules using clean solar energy.
GAO2022132845¡Simultaneous degradation of glucocorticoids and sterilization using bubbling corona discharge plasma based systems: A promising terminal water treatment facility for hospital wastewater¡Glucocorticoids (GCs)= Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)= Sterilization= Non-thermal plasma (NTP)¡Glucocorticoids (GCs) have drawn great concern due to their widespread contamination in the environment and application in treating patients with COVID-19. Due to the lack of data about GC removal using advanced treatment processes, a novel Paralleling and bubbling corona discharge reactor (PBCD) combined with iron-loaded activated-carbon fibre (Fe-ACF) was addressed in this study to degrade GCs represented by Hydrocortisone (HC) and Betamethasone (BT). The results showed that the PBCD-based system can degrade GCs effectively and can achieve effective sterilization. The removal rates of GCs were ranked as PBCD/Fe-ACF > PBCD/ACF > PBCD. The concentration of E. coli was reduced from 109 to 102 CFU/mL after 60 min of PBCD-based system treatment. The abundance of bacteria in actual Hospital wastewater (HWW) was significantly reduced. Plasma changed the physical and chemical properties of ACF and Fe-ACF by etching axial grooves and enhancing stretching vibrations of surface functional groups, thus promoting adsorption and catalytic degradation. For GC degradation, the functional reactive species were identified as •OH, 1O2, and •O2 radicals. Possible degradation pathways for HC and BT were proposed, which mainly included defluorination, keto acid decarboxylation, demethylation, intramolecular cyclization, cleavage and ester hydrolysis, indicating a reduction in GC toxicity. Since GCs are widely used in patients with COVID-19 and their wastewater needs to be sterilized simultaneously, the intensive and electrically driven PBCD-based system is promising in GC pollution control and sterilization in terminal water treatment facilities.
LIU2022132991¡Thin, flexible sulfide-based electrolyte film and its interface engineering for high performance solid-state lithium metal batteries¡Sulfide-based electrolyte= Flexible film= Interface engineering¡Sulfide electrolytes have attracted increasing attention due to their ultrahigh ionic conductivity and intrinsically soft properties. However, current solid-state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) based on sulfide electrolyte generally suffer from poor electrochemical performance due to the thick electrolyte layer and its terrible compatibility with Li metal anode. Herein, an ultrathin (∼60 μm) sulfide-based electrolyte film is prepared by a scalable slurry-casting method using Li10GeP2S12, polyethylene oxide, (3-chloropropyl)trimethoxysilane and nylon mesh (as a scaffold). Such film exhibits high ambient-temperature ionic conductivity (2.4 × 10−4 S cm−1), wide electrochemical window (4.7 V versus Li/Li+), outstanding heat-resistance and high mechanical strength (13.8 MPa). Furthermore, the compatibility of anode interface has been tremendously enhanced by the interface engineering of fluorine-rich gel protective layer on Li anode (Gel-Li) via in-situ polymerization, which can effectively prevent the lithium dendrite growth and endow outstanding long-term cyclic stability of the Li symmetric battery. As a result, the assembled MWCNT@S/Gel-Li and LiNbO3@LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2/Gel-Li batteries based on such electrolyte film display desirable discharge specific capacities and outstanding cycling stability at ambient-temperature. In addition, the integrated pouch cell can operate well even under harsh environments of bending, cutting, punching situations, demonstrating that such thin electrolyte and its interface engineering applied in SSLMBs with high safety and durability.
LV2022133064¡Disproportionation enabling reversible MnO2/Mn2+ transformation in a mild aqueous Zn-MnO2 hybrid battery¡Disproportionation= Zn-MnO hybrid battery= Mechanism= Deposition/dissolution¡The disproportionation of the Jahn-Teller (J-T) active manganese oxides (Mn3+) often leads to uncontrollable Mn2+ dissolution, which has been identified as one of the major causes of the performance degradation in conventional Zn-MnO2 batteries. Herein, we use the “unwanted” disproportionation of the Mn3+ cations to realize effective MnO2/Mn2+ transformation, achieving high specific capacity (550 mAh g−1) and good cycling stability (5000 cycles without capacity decay) in a Zn-MnO2 hybrid battery with mild aqueous electrolytes. Mechanism study shows that MnO2 is deposited on the cathode during charging, H+/Zn2+ insertion and disproportionation occur sequentially during discharging, leading to Mn2+ dissolution. The generated high-valence manganese oxides via disproportionation further experience reduction-disproportionation-dissolution, which proceeds repeatedly in the expanded discharge potential to 0 V vs. Zn2+/Zn, resulting in the complete dissolution of the cathodic materials. Our results provide the fundamental understanding on the controversial mechanisms of Zn-MnO2 batteries with mild aqueous electrolytes and highlight the effect of disproportionation in pushing the electrochemical performance of the promising Zn-MnO2 hybrid batteries.
OROZCOMENA2022133072¡Implementing a sustainable photochemical step to produce value-added products in flue gas desulfurization¡Flue Gas Desulfurization= Life Cycle Assessment= Process Simulation= Sulfite Photooxidation¡Coal consumption has led to a worrying surge in flue gas emissions, aggravating health and environmental issues worldwide. Therefore, novel approaches supported by sustainable technologies are needed to exploit flue gas emissions effectively. Here, we evaluate an ammonia-based flue gas desulfurization process based on the photochemical capture of CO2 and SO2 for producing hydrogen and ammonium-based fertilizers. The kinetics and mechanistic pathways for sulfite photooxidation are examined, while process feasibility and environmental relevance are evaluated by process simulation and life cycle assessment. Results show that increasing the initial sulfite concentration results in faster reaction rates, following first-order kinetics with an activation energy of 32.9 kJ/mol. Moreover, kinetics is ascribed to two competing photoinduced radical-mediated reaction pathways. Finally, powering the process by renewable energy leads to positive human health, ecosystems, and resources scores in life cycle assessment, supporting the sustainability of the process. Overall, this approach offers essential insights for large-scale hydrogen production through the photooxidation of captured flue gas emissions.
YAN2022132955¡Amorphous aerogel of trimetallic FeCoNi alloy for highly efficient oxygen evolution¡Trimetallic alloy= Aerogel= Amorphous= Electrocatalyst¡Developing highly efficient, cost-effective and extremely stable electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a great challenge for their promising water splitting application to promote the sluggish kinetics. In this work, an amorphous non-noble FeCoNi trimetallic aerogel (FeCoNi AG) is prepared via a one-step in situ spontaneous gelation and reduction strategy, presenting a remarkable OER activity and stability in an alkaline medium. FeCoNi AG catalyst delivers an exceptionally low overpotential of 235 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and features a small Tafel slope of 50 mV dec-1 in 1 M KOH, which is superior to the state-of-the-art RuO2 and many other reported transition FeCoNi-based catalysts. In addition, an outstanding long-term durability during 40 h chronoamperometric test and 5000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles without obvious degradation of current density is achieved. This work is of high inspiration for developing transition metals-based amorphous aerogel electrocatalysts for greatly enhanced oxygen evolution.
DONG2022133007¡Engineering attractive interaction in ZIF-based phase change materials for boosting electro- and photo- driven thermal energy storage¡Phase change materials= Energy storage materials= Electro-heat storage= Photo-heat storage¡Metal organic frameworks contain abundant empty space for selectively absorbing phase change materials (PCM) molecules and sometimes chemically transformed. However, the strong attractive interaction between metal organic frameworks and PCM severely blocks sufficient crystalline-amorphous state transition of PCM. Herein, we proposed an attractive interaction engineering strategy on hierarchical zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF) based phase change materials (polyethylene glycol/carbon cloth@ZIF, PEG/CC@ZIF) for boosting crystalline-amorphous state transition behavior and electro-/photo- driven thermal performance. Carboxyl-modified CC scaffold regulates attractive interaction between ZIF and PEG, which enhances energy storage capacity of the phase change composite. Moreover, ZIF nanoflakes deposited on the surface of CC reduce the convective heat loss at the solid–gas interface, and CC scaffold facilitates electron transportation and photon penetration, thus significantly enhancing electro- and photo- driven thermal energy storage. Furthermore, ZIF-induced chain effect between PEG and CC enhances the mechanical properties of PEG/CC@ZIF. Notably, commercially available transition metal oxide photocatalyst can be uniformly sprayed on the surface of PEG/CC@ZIF through coordination chemical engineering for multi-functional phase change composite.
ZANCO2022131000¡Heat transfer intensification with packed open-cell foams in TSA processes for CO2 capture¡TSA= Packed foam= Open-cell foam¡Packed open-cell foams are proposed as an alternative to standard packed bed configuration commonly adopted for the adsorption columns of a temperature swing adsorption process. In this contribution, heat transfer in an adsorption column with a packed foam configuration is investigated by experimental and modeling analysis, in comparison to a standard packed bed. The introduction of the packed foam allows for more rapid temperature transitions and substantial reduction of temperature gradients within the adsorption bed. The impact of this heat transfer enhancement on the separation performance of a temperature swing adsorption process is evaluated by modeling an example post-combustion CO2 capture application. Although the presence of the foam implies a loss of sorbent inventory (-26.5%), higher process productivity (+80%) is achieved thanks to faster temperature swings and more homogeneous temperature distribution within the adsorption columns.
JIANG2022132939¡Contrasting effects of microplastic aging upon the adsorption of sulfonamides and its mechanism¡Microplastic= Aging= Sulfonamides¡The aging behavior of microplastics (MPs) is unavoidable in the natural environment, but the mechanisms underlying the differences in MP aging affecting the adsorption performance of different MPs remain unclear. In this work, the adsorption characteristics of sulfonamides (SAs) on virgin MPs (thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPUs), polyamides (PAs)) and aged MPs were determined under simulated conditions (ultraviolet (UV), ultraviolet combined hydrogen peroxide (UV + H2O2)). Contrasting effects of MP aging on SA adsorption were observed. That is, the adsorption capacities of aged PAs were decreased from 14.45% to 58.53%, whereas those of aged TPUs were increased from 13.93% to 171.30%. To interpret this interesting phenomenon, the structural characteristics of the tested MPs were determined, and the results indicated that the surface structures of MPs changed with aging, which resulted in differences in hydrophobicity and surface charge and a significant difference in the concentrations of oxygen-containing functional groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) results revealed that the equilibrium configurations and the interactions (H bond, electrostatic effect, van der Waals (vdW) forces were significantly influenced by the change in the concentration of oxygen-containing functional groups of MPs (P < 0.05), with the strength of H bonds increasing for aged TPUs-SAs and the strength of electrostatic interactions decreasing for aged PA-SAs. Our findings are the first to provide a theoretical basis for an improved understanding of the role of aging in SAs adsorption onto MPs.
ZHANG2022132963¡Bismuth-rich strategy intensifies the molecular oxygen activation and internal electrical field for the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride¡BiOBr= BiOBr= Photocatalytic= Molecular oxygen activation¡Bismuth-rich photocatalyst (Bi3O4Br) and BiOBr were prepared by a simple hydrothermal method with different pH values. The increase in the atomic ratio of Bi/Br led to an upshift in the conduction band minimum and enhancement of hybridization. Therefore, molecular oxygen activation and the internal electrical field were strengthened by the rich bismuth strategy, and it resulted in better photocatalytic degradation and mineralization of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC). Trapping agent experiments and ESR results indicated that the degradation process was dominated by ·O2- while 1O2 was also a key factor. The upshift of CBM from −0.34 eV (BiOBr) to −0.43 eV (Bi3O4Br) accelerated the production of ·O2-. At the same time, the highly efficient separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs could be attributed to the transformation of O2/·O2- and enhancement of hybridization, which were proven by photoelectrochemical measurement, PL and time-resolved PL spectra. The degradation pathway of TC dominated by ·O2- and 1O2 was also discussed.
CHEN2022132951¡Reduced graphene oxide-supported hollow Co3O4@N-doped porous carbon as peroxymonosulfate activator for sulfamethoxazole degradation¡Peroxymonosulfate= ROS contribution ratio= Degradation mechanism= Ecotoxicity¡A novel reduced graphene oxide-supported hollow Co3O4@N-doped porous carbon (Co3O4@NPC/rGO) composite was synthesized via self-assembly and pyrolysis-oxidation using bimetallic zeolite imidazolate frameworks and graphene oxide as precursors. The as-obtained composite exhibited superior performance on peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation over a wide pH range. Complete removal of sulfamethoxazole (SMX, 25 mg·L−1) was achieved within 5 min and the reaction rate constant was higher than those of the most reported heterogeneous catalyst/PMS systems for SMX degradation. It was demonstrated that both radical pathways (SO4−, OH, and O2−) and non-radical pathways (1O2 and direct electron transfer) were involved in the SMX degradation. Significantly, the contribution ratio of each reactive oxidative species (ROS) in the bulk solution or on the catalyst surface was differentiated and calculated for the first time. SO4− both in the bulk solution and on the catalyst surface as well as the 1O2 in the bulk solution were the dominant ROS. The possible degradation mechanism of SMX by Co3O4@NPC/rGO/PMS system was proposed. Co active sites with high activity, the electron-rich ketonic group and the nitrogen doping sites within Co3O4@NPC/rGO contributed to the excellent catalytic activity. The ecotoxicity of SMX and its intermediates was investigated. Besides, the reusability, stability and application potential in actual waterbodies of Co3O4@NPC/rGO were evaluated. Overall, this work expands the environmental application of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)-derived hollow nanomaterials and provides a promising heterogeneous catalyst for the elimination of refractory contaminants by sulfate radical-based advanced oxidation processes (SR-AOPs).
CHEN2022133024¡Interfacial synthesized covalent organic framework nanofiltration membranes for precisely ultrafast sieving¡Interfacial synthesis= Covalent organic frameworks= Composite membranes= Selective molecular sieving¡Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a series of crystalline materials with ordered nanopores, are highly desirable for ultrafast and selective nanofiltration. However, COF-based membranes are typically synthesized via difficult synthetic procedures with long reaction time and show poor mechanical properties, which may hinder their widespread applications. Herein, a facile interfacial method is developed to synthesize COF membranes via the synergistic effect of interfacial diffusion and in-phase Brownian motion. Continuous free-standing COF films with a thickness of 111 nm are obtained within only 3 h under mild reaction conditions. Meanwhile, this synthesis method is suitable for the fabrication of COF membranes with a thin-film-composite (TFC) structure, enabling obtained COF membranes good mechanical properties under external forces and practical nanofiltration tests. Compared with other reported nanofiltration membranes, TFC-COFs exhibit state-of-the-art water permeance (173.94 L m2 h−1 bar−1) and superior rejections exceeding 98.50% to dyes larger than 1.3 nm. Precisely selective sieving of obtained TFC-COFs is systematically studied by separating diverse mixed dye solutions. Furthermore, monomers used in this method can be replaced, creating COF-based membranes with customizable functionality to enable a broad range of selective separations.
LI2022132979¡CO2 capture and activation with a plasma-sorbent system¡CO2 capture= Plasma system= CO2 conversion= Sorbents¡Non-thermal plasma-induced one-step desorption of splitting of CO2 has been investigated in this research for carbon capture and utilization. An experimental study was conducted in a plasma-sorbent system that consists of a coaxial DBD reactor packed with hydrotalcite pellets. Operation parameters including discharge power and carrier gas flow rate were varied to explore their effect on the desorption of CO2 from the sorbent and conversion to CO. Results showed that the discharge power plays the dominant role in the desorption process. Faster desorption was achieved with increasing power but at a cost of CO2 conversion. Although the carrier gas flow rate does not have a significant effect on the desorption, higher conversion was achieved with a higher flow rate due to the dilution effect. The maximum single pass conversion of CO2 achieved was 67.44%. Based on the feature of this technology, periodic operation of multiple reactors including reactors in parallel and in series are discussed for continuous CO2 capture and its full conversion.
CAO2022133043¡High-rate long-lasting solar desalination towards hypersaline brine enabled by introducing a siphon-drop mode¡Direct solar steam generation= Siphon-drop mode= Top-down active water diffusion= Strong brine¡Direct solar steam generation (DSSG) is well-proven to be a sustainable and effective technique to provide high-quality freshwater supply. However, it customarily suffers from severe salt accumulation, especially for treating strong brine, becoming a fatal bottleneck for approaching its commercial applications. Herein, we developed a DSSG with potent siphon-drop mode to achieve powerful self-absorbing and self-desalting, in which the 3D cone-shaped self-supporting polydopamine and polyethyleneimine co-coated poly(acrylonitrile-styrene-acrylate) (PDA-PEI@ASA) used as photothermal material (PTM). Source water can be spontaneously and continuously pumped to the top of water-evaporating surface of PTM via strong siphon effect, and the top-down active water diffusion on evaporating surface can effectively take the salts away from the system. Such above features give the DSSG real-time antifouling nature and hence address the fatal issue of salt accumulation. Accordingly, when continuously treating a near-saturated brine (20% NaCl) for at least 168 h, no obvious salts deposition can be found with a steady water evaporation rate of ∼2.550 kg m–2 h−1. This work could help shed novel light on the design of practical DSSG systems toward efficient lasting freshwater extraction, holding great promise for global water scarcity.
LI2022131996¡Enhanced performance of anaerobic two-phase reactor treating coal gasification wastewater with the assistance of zero valent iron under co-digestion conditions¡Coal gasification wastewater= Refractory pollutants= Anaerobic two-phase reactor= Zero-valent iron¡Coal gasification wastewater (CGW) is a typical industrial wastewater that is difficult to degrade as it contains a large number of refractory and toxic pollutants, such as high concentrations of phenols.The aim of this study is to investigate an anaerobic two-phase reactor treating synthetic CGW under co-digestion conditions. The optimum dosages of co-substrate (glucose = 1000 mg/L), zero valent iron (ZVI) (2 g/L), and hydrolysis acidification time (12 h) were explored by batch tests. The results indicated that the concentration of total phenols declined from 636 mg/L to 376 mg/L when the cumulative methane production increased to 145 mL. In the long-term operation of the anaerobic two-phase reactor, 1,000 mg/L glucose was added to the influent, and 2 g/L ZVI was added in the methanogenic phase, respectively. HRTs in acidogenic and methanogenic phases were kept at 12 h and 48 h, respectively. The average acetate and TVFAs concentrations remained at approximately 852 mg/L and 1042 mg/L, respectively. The result showed that the concentrations of influent and effluent COD were approximately 3,191 mg/L and 412 mg/L, respectively, while those of influent and effluent total phenols were approximately 655 mg/L and 23 mg/L, respectively. The removal efficiencies of total COD and total phenols were over 86% and 96%, respectively. In addition, the total methane production rose to 250 mL/d. Microbial community structure analysis demonstrated that the acidogenic phase contained most types of microbial species and the most complex community diversity in the anaerobic system and that direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) might occur between the potential electroactive bacteria Chloroflexi and the archaea Methanobacteriales and Methanosaeta, respectively.
FIJOL2022132964¡3D-printable biopolymer-based materials for water treatment: A review¡3D printing= Biopolymers= Water treatment= Metal removal= Oil separation¡The global environmental concerns drive scientists all over the world to develop eco-friendly and sustainable alternatives to techniques and materials commonly used until now for water treatment applications. The relatively novel Additive manufacturing (AM) technology allows to process materials in a custom optimized, cost and time effective manner, while use of biobased materials minimizes the secondary pollution issue. Combining three-dimensional (3D) printing technology and biopolymer-based materials refines the water treatment industry, as it provides tailored water filtration systems easily available in the disadvantaged areas at low environmental impact and cost due to the raw materials’ bio-origin and abundance. This review highlights the combination of various 3D printing techniques such as Fused deposition modelling (FDM), Direct ink wetting (DIW) and Stereolitography (SLA) with nature-derived biopolymers and biopolymer-based materials including chitosan, Polylactic acid (PLA), alginate and Cellulose acetate (CA) for their potential application within the water treatment industry with emphasis on oil separation and metal removal. Moreover, the environmental impact of the revised biopolymers is briefly discussed.
LIU2022132990¡Tailoring oxygenated groups of monolithic cobalt-nitrogen-carbon frameworks for highly efficient hydrogen peroxide production in acidic media¡Oxygen reduction reaction= Hydrogen peroxide= Electrocatalysis= Selectivity¡Electrochemical synthesis has emerged as a promising alternative method for industrial production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Although transition metal-nitrogen-carbon moieties have been regarded as efficient catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), they are generally established for four-electron (4e−) pathway, rather than two-electron (2e−) one for selective generation of H2O2. Herein, we propose a strategy to achieve cobalt-carbon hybrids with high 2e− selectivity for H2O2 production in acidic media via tailoring their surface structure and coordination environment. The correlation between 2e− ORR selectivity of the fabricated monolithic electrodes, i.e. Co nanoparticles embedded in N-doped oxo carbon framework (CoNCF), and their oxygen-containing functional groups is revealed. In particular, an excellent H2O2 selectivity over 91 % in 0.05 M H2SO4 is achieved, which exceeds most of previously reported 2e− ORR electrocatalysts. Moreover, a sterilization system for water disinfection is constructed, demonstrating potential practical applications. The smart design of multi-active sites and porous monolithic architecture opens a new avenue for preparing advanced electrode for H2O2 generation and other environment/energy-related systems.
ZHOU2022133035¡Tuning selectivity of electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 by atomically dispersed Pt into SnO2 nanoparticles¡CO reduction= SnO= atomically dispersed Pt= HCOO¡Electrochemical reduction of CO2 into fuels offers an attractive approach to environmental and energy sustainability. Herein, we designed atomically dispersed Pt into SnO2 catalyst (Pt atom/SnO2). Such catalyst dramatically improves the adsorption performance of CO2 and lowers the activation energy of CO2. DFT calculations indicate that the doping of Pt in SnO2 could induce charge redistribution and tune active electronic state, showing higher adsorption energy for intermediates CO2*, HCOO* and HCOOH*, which is different from the Pt NPs loaded SnO2 mainly for H2 generation. As a result, a higher Faradaic efficiency (82.1 ± 1.4%) and the production rate (5105 μmol h−1 cm−2) of HCOO– are achieved at −1.2 V vs. RHE. Moreover, the current density and Faradaic efficiency of HCOO– nearly remain unchanged in 8 h on the Pt atom/SnO2, indicating its high stability. This work opens up a new avenue to tune product selectivity by atomically dispersed catalysts.
ZHAO2022132961¡Mechanism of β-cypermethrin metabolism by Bacillus cereus GW-01¡Beta-cypermethrin= Biodegradation= Oxidative stress= Multi-omics analysis= Mechanism¡Pesticide residues in soil and food are of concern for human health. Biodegradation is an attractive option for reducing these residues, but more insight into the mechanism of degradation is necessary to ensure that toxic deadend products are not produced in the process. In this study, a β-cypermethrin (β-CY) degrading bacterium which we named GW-01 was isolated from a sheep’s rumen chyme. HPLC analyses of culture extracts revealed that train GW-01 degraded ∼ 60 % of 100 mg/L β‑CY within 7 d. Strain GW-01 transiently accumulated 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), phenol, and benzoic acid during β-CY degradation. Genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses of GW-01 during degradation of β-CY and its metabolites provided evidence that an α/β- hydrolase and a cytochrome aa3 quinol oxidase were responsible for the degradation of β-CY and 3-PBA, respectively. Chlorohydrolase was implicated in the degradation of phenol to catechol. Transcriptional and proteomic evidence was also found for upregulation of the benzoic acid degradation pathway and meta-pathway (catechol-2,3-dioxygenase), respectively. Based on these results a pathway for β-CY degradation is propose that provides greater insight into the mechanism of pyrethroid degradation by microorganisms.
KUMAR2022132966¡Electrochemical sensors for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus¡SARS-CoV-2= Electrochemical sensor= COVID-19¡Coronavirus (COVID-19), a deadly pandemic has spread worldwide and created many global health issues. Though methods of its detection are being continuously developed for the early detection and monitoring of COVID-19, still there is need for more novel methods. The presently used methods include rapid antigen tests, serological surveys, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), artificial intelligence-based techniques, and assays based on sensors/biosensors. Of all these, RT-PCR test has high sensitivity and specificity though it requires more time for testing and need for skilled technicians. Recently, electrochemical sensors have been developed for rapid monitoring and detection of SARS-CoV-2 from the patient’s biological fluid samples.

LIN2022133018¡ε-Poly-l-lysine as an efficient cartilage penetrating and residing drug carrier with high intraarticular injection safety for treating osteoarthritis¡ε-poly-l-lysine= Osteoarthritis= Cationic macromolecular carrier¡A major reason that hinders the clinical application of disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) is the unmet challenges in their effective delivery to cartilage. Cationic macromolecules represent promising carriers to enhance the drug delivery to cartilage through their electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged cartilage matrix. However, current candidate cationic macromolecular carriers (CMCs) must solve the intractable challenges in scalable production and biosafety before they can be used clinically. ε-poly-l-lysine (ε-PLL) is a unique poly (amino acid) that has favorable features to conquer the above issues. In this study, we evaluated the potential of ε-PLL as a cost effectiveness, biosafety, and effective CMC for drug delivery to cartilage. Cartilage explant from pig knee was used as a model for the in vitro analysis of ε-PLL’s interaction with, penetration into, and resident in cartilage tissue. The results showed that ε-PLL had a strong distribution tendency in cartilage with partition coefficient K ∼ 4.3 and weak cartilage matrix binding ability (KD ∼ 310 μM) with abundant intra-cartilage binding sites (N ∼ 9900 μM). Furthermore, ε-PLL could also penetrate full thickness cartilage and showed a long-time retention in cartilage explants and mouse joint cavity. The results of in vitro and in vivo toxicity tests showed nearly no negative impact of ε-PLL (100 μg/mL) on chondrocytes or local tissue. Using kartogenin (KGN, a potential DMOAD) as a model drug, the effectiveness of ε-PLL to improve the drug bioavailability in a mouse OA model was proved. Together, these results suggest that ε-PLL can be used as an effective and safe CMC for effective DMOAD delivery to cartilage.
QU2022132954¡Facile coating of MnO2 nanoparticles onto polymer fibers via friction-heating adhesion for efficient formaldehyde removal¡Friction-heating adhesion= MnO loading= Catalytic oxidation= Formaldehyde¡Loading catalyst nanoparticles onto polymer fibers for the removal of indoor pollutants such as HCHO encounters many problems such as uneven distribution, active site coverage, high cost and environmental pollution. Here we efficiently loaded MnO2 on the surface of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers (MnO2@PET) within 10 s by utilizing the friction heat and mechanical action generated between MnO2 and PET fibers during rapid stirring. The thickness of the MnO2 coating ranged from ∼0.14 µm to 2.19 µm. After initial weight loss of 10.2 ∼ 10.4% in the first 30 min, the composite fibers remained stable weight in the later 150 min during ultrasonic oscillation, indicating the durability and fastness of the MnO2 coating. As-synthesized MnO2@PET composites enabled superior HCHO removal rate (95.5%) and conversion to CO2 (75.5%) within 120 min at room temperature, and it can be easily regenerated at low temperature (60 °C).
REZENDEMOREIRA2022133006¡Enhancing industries exploitation: Integrated and hybrid membrane separation processes applied to industrial effluents beyond the treatment for disposal¡Industrial ecology= Effluent valorization= Mining from wastewater= Hybrid technologies= Integrated systems¡Facilities intended for industrial effluents treatment for only disposal are no longer interesting from an environmental and economical perspective. Rather than that, they started to be designed for by-products recovery as well. Stand-alone treatment units are often ineffective for that purpose, which led to researches that investigate integrated and hybrid treatments. It has been reviewed integrated membrane-based technologies intended for by-products recovery from industrial effluents in bench and full-scale applications. Consolidated technologies as ultra-, micro-, nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membrane have been combined with different biological and physicochemical technologies that allow for by-products recovery. It has been summarized the merits and demerits of their integration, in addition to recommendations to improve their efficiency. Besides the conventional membrane separation processes, emerging technologies as electrodialysis and membrane contactors (membrane scrubbers, membrane distillation, and membrane crystallizers) were summarized. Although considered emerging, they have a great potential to be further scale-up and combined with different processes. Aside from their performance in effluent treatment and by-product recovery, their economic viability has been discussed as well. Up-coming membrane modules combining different processes, markedly known for their small area requirement and performance improvement, were also presented. The current literature points out integrated/hybrid systems and effluents valorization as one of the alternatives to overcome the scarcity of the raw materials to be faced in a near future. However, advancements in membranes of greater resistance, lower costs, antifouling characteristics, and lower propensity for wetting would be of paramount importance to extend the application of these systems for effluents beneficiation.
ZHU2022132843¡Multifunctional Cl-S double-doped carbon nitride nanotube unit in catalytic ozone oxidation synergistic photocatalytic system: Generation of ROS-rich region and effective treatment of organic wastewater¡Catalytic ozone oxidation synergistic photocatalysis= Nanotube unit= ROS-rich region= Domestic sewage¡Catalytic ozone oxidation synergistic photocatalysis (COP) can effectively overcome the shortcomings of incomplete mineralization and strong pH dependence of O3 and slow reaction rate of photocatalytic. Cl, S double-doped carbon nitride nanotube unit (Cl/S-CN) with the ability of catalyzing O3 and visible light photocatalysis was synthesized by hydrothermal self-repairing method to improve the applicability of the COP system in actual organic wastewater. Characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations found that Cl/S-CN has a stable and ordered nanotube (tube diameter: 56 nm) arrangement, a good energy band structure, and excellent e- delivery efficiency. It can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS)-rich region in the unit to promote the ROS chain cycle reaction, thereby generating more numbers and types of (non–)free radicals to participate in the degradation of organic pollution. For tetracycline (100 mg/L), the degradation rate in O3/vis/Cl/S-CN system was 90.1% at 10 min, and the degradation rate of TOC was 78% at 30 min. For P-nitrophenol (20 mg/L), the degradation rate was 91.6% at 20 min, and the degradation rate of TOC was 66% at 30 min. The COD degradation rates of influent water, secondary effluent water and oilfield produced water in COP system at 30 min were 70.5%, 83.4% and 76.5%, respectively. Cl/S-CN can catalyze the production of high activity ROS-rich region in COP system, effectively promote the production of ·OH, 1O2 and other active substances, and improve the applicability of COP system in actual organic wastewater.
KUMAR2022133031¡Artificial leaf for light-driven CO2 reduction: Basic concepts, advanced structures and selective solar-to-chemical products¡Artificial photosynthesis= Artificial leaf= Selective CO conversion= Photocatalytic prototypes¡To date, the elevating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are becoming a global concern, which has promoted scientists to seek possible solutions for reducing CO2 emissions or capturing them. Solar light-assisted catalytic conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals has been considered viable to mitigate the environmental and energy crisis simultaneously. In this regard, an artificial photosynthesis system, often called “artificial leaf” consisting of substantial structural components and reaction parameters of natural photosynthesis to attain solar light-driven CO2 conversion, is up-and-coming. Inspired by natural leaves, photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic artificial leaf structures that mimic natural photosynthesis and efficiently utilize solar energy to convert CO2 into value-added products are of great significance. This review focuses on the basic concepts of photo/electrocatalytic artificial leaf systems, emphasizing advanced structural arrangements and the mechanistic insights for CO2 reduction. The recent advances in the structural design of artificial leaves involving Z-scheme biocatalytic photoelectrochemical devices, photocatalytic prototype, and latest 3D printing has been extensively explored and discussed. The crucial applications of artificial leaf devices for the selective conversion of CO2 into carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and formate have been outlined. Finally, we conclude and provide a vision with an in-depth discussion on how the present state-of-the-art advances and various challenges in this field. We expect to believe this comprehensive study could stimulate more remarkable research efforts to design efficient artificial leaf for light-driven CO2 reduction towards selective solar-to-chemical products in the coming years.
HUANG2022132962¡Rational designed molecularly imprinted triazine-based porous aromatic frameworks for enhanced palladium capture via three synergistic mechanisms¡Molecular imprinting technology= Photocatalysis= Chemical reduction= Adsorption¡Herein, molecular imprinting technology (MIT) was introduced into construction of molecularly imprinted triazine-based porous aromatic frameworks (MI-TBPAFs) via Heck-coupling reaction for palladium extracting from wastewater. According to the decorating Pd-vinylpyridine complex (Pd@Vpy), MI-TBPAFs were given considerable tailor-made binding sites with strong affinities for palladium, which captured palladium from various metal ions precisely. The adsorption experiments showed that the extraction capacity of MI-TBPAF-3 was improved by 59.0% (435.4 mg/g) under simulated sunlight radiation. Mechanism analysis proved that Pd2+ was reduced into Pd0 by MI-TBPAF-3 via photocatalytic and chemical reduction effects originating from triazine base and pyridine nitrogen atoms in the extended π-conjugated framework respectively, thereby greatly increasing adsorption capacity by the sorption-reduction strategy. Organically combining the advantages of MIT, photocatalytic reduction and chemical reduction, three synergistic mechanisms, not only provides a new strategy for highly efficient palladium extraction, but also inspires new insights for precious metal recovery.
YANG2022133047¡Core-shell trimetallic NiFeV disulfides and amorphous high-valance NiFe hydroxide nanosheets enhancing oxygen evolution reaction¡Oxygen evolution reaction (OER)=  electrochemical tuning= Trimetallic NiFeV disulfide= Core–shell structure¡Developing highly efficient, stable, and earth-abundant heterogeneous electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a significant challenge. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel core–shell trimetallic Ni0.70Fe0.10V0.20S2 @ amorphous NiFe hydroxide for enhancing OER kinetics using thermal sulfidation and in situ electrochemical tuning methods. Electrochemical testing of various as-prepared catalysts at the same mass loading demonstrated that the trimetallic Ni0.70Fe0.10V0.20S2 @ amorphous NiFe hydroxide possessed the highest intrinsic activity for the OER compared to other reference catalysts. Furthermore, the heterostructures are directly grown on a carbon paper with a high surface area and good conductivity to form an integrated 3D electrode with an overpotential of 204 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm-2 and a small Tafel slope of 39 mV dec-1 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. This is one of the most effective OER electrocatalysts. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy indicated that the material structure and chemical composition of Ni0.70Fe0.10V0.20S2 @ amorphous NiFe hydroxide exhibited good stability under harsh OER conditions. These advantages could be mainly attributed to the synergistic effect between the core and shell, high electronic conductivity of the core, and more active sites on the surface of the amorphous shell. Additionally, this study provides novel insights for designing and synthesizing heterostructure multimetallic disulfides electrocatalysts for OER in the future.
LUO2022132854¡A facile strategy to achieve efficient flame-retardant cotton fabric with durable and restorable fire resistance¡Phosphorus-nitrogen synergistic flame retardant= Cotton fabrics= Washing durability¡Novel, durably flame-retardant cotton fabrics with fascinatingly restorable fire resistance were prepared by simple grafting of phosphate and melamine, which contributed to a phosphorous-nitrogen (P/N) synergism. During the preparation process, phosphate was grafted with the hydroxyl groups of cellulose to form P-O-C bonds; subsequently, melamine reacted with the aldehyde groups of cellulose generated from phosphorylation to form P/N modified fabrics (P/N-Cotton). The P/N synergistic effect endowed cotton fabric with prominent fire resistance and durability. The Limit oxygen index (LOI) was as high as 51.1 ± 0.3% and was maintained at 32.7 ± 0.8% after 50 laundering cycles (LCs). The total heat release (THR) and peak values of heat release rate (pHRR) of P/N-Cotton were significantly reduced by 70.11% and 64.19%, respectively. Amazingly, the modified cotton fabrics exhibited restorable fire resistance once immersed into the acetic acid solution due to the ion exchange between Na+ from detergent and H+ from acetic acid. The LOI of P-Cotton and P/N-Cotton after 50 LCs can be restored to 32.4 ± 0.7% and 35.7 ± 0.7% from 20.8 ± 0.7% and 32.7 ± 0.8%, respectively. The analysis of gas-phase products and residual char demonstrated that the incorporation of phosphate and melamine facilitated cellulose fibers to convert to dense and stable graphitized carbon layers and carbon-nitrogen heterocycles, effectively protecting the fabric from decomposing to flammable gases.
ZHANG2022132950¡Fluorine-free strategy for hydroxylated Ti3C2/Ti3AlC2 catalysts with enhanced aerobic oxidative desulfurization and mechanism¡MXene= Alkaline etching= morphology= Chemical composition and electronic structure¡Hydrofluoric acid is inevitable in most preparation schemes for two-dimensional MXene materials, which is dangerous and environmentally hazardous. Herein, hydroxylated Ti3C2/Ti3AlC2 (h-TC/TAC) catalysts were prepared via an alkaline etching process using a safer, more environmentally friendly alkali. After preferentially forming a hydroxylated Ti3C2 MXene layer on the surface of Ti3AlC2, Ti-C bonds on the surface were partially hydrolyzed, which exposed more active sites. Alkaline etching modulated the chemical composition and electronic structure of the catalyst surface, thus concentrating the active sites on the surface, which improved the activation efficiency and substrate conversion. For the aerobic oxidative desulfurization of a model fuel with a sulfur content of 220 ppm, the prepared catalyst exhibited a desulfurization rate of up to 99% when using air as a cheap molecular oxygen source. The enhanced activity of the h-TC/TAC catalyst was attributed to the continuous activation of molecular oxygen to form •OH and •O2–. Moreover, because the main structure of Ti3AlC2 was maintained, the catalyst could be recycled 8 times without a significant decrease in activity. This work not only shows the potential of alkaline etching for preparing MXene materials but also provides an important example of the thermocatalytic application of MXene and MAX phase materials.
LI2022132953¡Electronic configuration of single ruthenium atom immobilized in urchin-like tungsten trioxide towards hydrazine oxidation-assisted hydrogen evolution under wide pH media¡Single atom= Hydrogen evolution= Hydrazine oxidation= Couple system¡Replacing sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) is an energy-saving approach to assist alkaline overall water splitting (OWS). However, it is still at the infant stage as the unsatisfactory of the design strategies for bifunctional catalysts toward both HzOR and hydrogen evolution, which leads to high working potential compared to the theoretical value. Here, for the first time, we report a galvanostatic immobilization of ruthenium single atoms (Ru SAs) into the oxygen vacancy of urchin-like tungsten trioxide (Vo-WO3) and show low overpotentials of 17, 34, and 64 mV at –10 mA cm–2 under acid, alkaline, and neutral H2 evolution, respectively. As an efficient bifunctional catalyst, the Vo-WO3/Ru SAs is firstly introduced to HzOR and achieves low working potential of –58 mV at 10 mA cm–2. The HzOR-assisted OWS also delivers an ultralow cell voltage of only 25 mV at 10 mA cm–2 in alkaline medium, which is far beyond the platinum and most of the state-of-the-art catalysts. Additionally, this coupled system can also be well performed under neutral condition, realizing a cell voltage of only 137 mV at 10 mA cm–2. The excellent pH-universal HzOR-assisted OWS activity is attributed to the particular electronic configuration between Ru SAs and WO3, the immobilization of Ru SAs in WO3 could induce electron redistribution and optimize free energy of hydrogen adsorption in hydrogen evolution, while the isolation of Ru SAs also leads to the electropositivity of W sites and tends to accelerate the oxidation of hydrazine.
LEE2022132995¡Amorphization of germanium selenide driven by chemical interaction with carbon and realization of reversible conversion-alloying reaction for superior K-ion storage¡Potassium ion battery= Layered germanium selenide= Amorphization= Chemical bonding¡Chemical interaction with carbon has been employed to establish electron conduction pathways through intimate contact with anode materials. It is highly plausible that the strong chemical interaction can change the crystallinity as well as bonding nature of anode materials. This highlights the importance of chemical interaction with carbon and its effects on the material and electrochemical properties of anode materials. However, this is not yet investigated. This study is the first report on the amorphization of layered structured GeSe induced by the chemical interaction and its implications on the electrochemical properties for K-ion batteries. The charge storage mechanism of GeSe/CNT composite, investigated using ex-situ X-ray diffraction, indicates that reversible conversion-alloying reaction of GeSe is realized by the amorphization, which is closely linked with weakening of Ge–Se bonds derived from the strong chemical interaction and a concomitant increase in K-ion diffusion. As a result, the GeSe/CNT composite exhibits excellent electrochemical properties. Similar amorphization driven by chemical interaction is also observed for other layered structured anode materials. This study provides new insights on the chemical interaction of layered anode materials with carbon. Our findings could effectively be used to realize reversible conversion reaction for other anode materials for advanced secondary batteries.
XIANG2022133008¡Degradation of sulfamethazine in UV/monochloramine process: Kinetics, by-products formation, and toxicity evaluation¡Ultraviolet combined monochloramine (UV/NH2Cl) process is a promising advanced oxidation process (AOP) to remove organic micropollutants effectively through the generation of various reactive species e.g., hydroxyl radicals (HO•), reactive chlorine species (RCS), and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). This study investigated the kinetics, transformation pathways, DBPs formation, and toxicity alternation in the degradation of sulfamethazine (SMT). Based on the calculation of degradation kinetic models, RNS was proved to be the most important reactive species in the degradation of SMT in UV/NH2Cl. The contribution of RNS, HO• and RCS were approximately 56.6%, 38.8%, and 4.5%, respectively. With the NH2Cl dosage increased from 100 to 800 µmol L-1, degradation rate increased from 37% to 73% in 10 min. Significantly alternation was not observed with the changing of pH. Natural organic matter (NOM) remarkably inhibited the degradation rate to 48.6% and 32.8% in the presence of 1 and 2 mg L-1 NOM. Degradation reactions of SMT in UV/NH2Cl system primarily comprised of hydroxylation, nitrosation, and ring opening reactions. The total theoretical toxicity of degradation system increased in the first 20 min and decreased eventually. Comparing with UV/free chlorine (UV/Cl2) process, less disinfection by-products (DBPs) generated in UV/NH2Cl treatment. Thus, the theoretical toxicity of DBPs formed in UV/NH2Cl was much lower than UV/Cl2. Within 40 min degradation, the theoretical toxicity value reached maximum at pH 7.1 due to the mass production of dicloroacetonitrile (DCAN). Bromide ions (10 µmol L-1) significantly promoted the formation of brominated DBPs especially dibromoacetonitrile (DBAN). This study provided insight into the important role of RNS in the SAs’ transformation in UV/NH2Cl process and reference to benefits and disadvantages when selecting the process for disinfection in drinking water treatment.
JIANG2022132823¡Recent advances of metal–organic frameworks in corrosion protection: From synthesis to applications¡Metal-organic frameworks= Corrosion protection= Inhibitor= Nano-filler¡Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a subclass of hybrid-type crystalline materials that consist of metal ions (or clusters) and organic ligands, has received remarkable attention in both inorganic and organic chemistry fields in recent decades. Benefiting from their significant features such as large specific surface area, adjustable structure and function, regular pore arrangement and abundant active sites, MOFs exhibit great application prospects as anticorrosion materials. Herein, this review focuses on the latest research progress of MOF-based corrosion protection materials and reviews their anticorrosion performance, including the commonly concerned fabrication approaches of MOFs for corrosion protection with their respective advantages and shortcomings, the different anticorrosion applications, and the presented challenges that need to be conquered in practical applications. Meanwhile, we detailedly introduce the corrosion protection mechanisms of MOFs when serve as inhibitors, nano-fillers, nano-containers, and surficial protecting coatings. At the end of this review, the future outlooks of MOFs for corrosion protection is provided, we hope this review will illuminate the achievement of high performed anticorrosion MOFs and offer new ideas for the development of MOF-based materials for future corrosion protection application.
ZHANG2022132992¡Self-assembled Cobalt-doped NiMn-layered double hydroxide (LDH)/V2CTx MXene hybrids for advanced aqueous electrochemical energy storage properties¡MXene= Hetero ion doping effect= Synergic self-assemble= Zinc ion batteries¡High-performance aqueous electrochemical energy storage technology has attracted extensive research interest due to its high safety and potential for commercialization. Herein, following the simultaneous doping-electrostatic synergistic assembly strategy, we synthesized the 2D/2D Co-doped NiMn-Layered double hydroxide (LDH)/V2CTx MXene (CNMV) composite materials that serve as advanced electrodes for aqueous energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and zinc ion batteries (ZIBs). For supercapacitors, benefiting from the hetero ion doping effect, the as-assembled CNMV electrode exhibits a higher specific capacitance of 1005 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1. For the assembled asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) devices, a high energy density of 30.16 Wh kg−1 at 0.7 kW kg−1 was achieved. Acting as the cathode for ZIBs, CNMV exhibits a high reversible capacity of 322.7 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 after 100 cycles, and a considerable energy density of 368.7 W h kg−1 at a power density of 246 W kg−1. The battery-type transformation tothe pseudocapacitance-type CNMV electrode for the supercapacitor was demonstrated by quantitative kinetic analysis, while phase transformation and Zn2+ insertion/extraction for zinc ion storage mechanism were demonstrated by ex-situ XRD and XPS. This study provides a facile and effective approach for the design of high-performance MXene-based electrodes for aqueous electrochemical energy storage devices.
ZHANG2022132997¡Anisotropically conductive Mg(NO3)2·6H2O/g-C3N4-graphite sheet phase change material for enhanced photo-thermal storage¡Mg(NO)·6HO= g-CN= Graphite sheet= Anisotropic thermal conduction¡The use of phase change materials (PCMs) for solar thermal collection can solve the mismatch problem of energy supply and demand caused by intermittent solar radiation. Traditionally, photo-thermal storage performance has been limited by the low thermal conductivity of PCMs and the massive heat transfer loss between PCMs and their external environment. Herein, we demonstrate that embedding a highly oriented graphite sheet (GS) network in a PCM results in an anisotropic thermal conduction structure, endowing the material with rapid internal thermal conduction and reduced heat loss to the external environment, thereby enhancing photo-thermal storage performance. We imitate the structure of layer cake to create a multilayered composite phase change material (CPCM), Mg(NO3)2∙6H2O/g-C3N4-GS (MNH/CN-GS), which has a highly oriented anisotropic thermal conductivity. The through-plane and in-plane thermal conductivities of MNH/CN-GS reach 0.55 and 15.70 W/(m·K), respectively, at 40 wt% GS loading in the CN-GS matrix. This corresponds to a high anisotropic degree of thermal conduction of 28.56, which results in a high average photo-thermal storage efficiency of 88.4%. The photo-thermal storage efficiency remains above 80% even at a high temperature of approximately 94 ℃. The proposed anisotropic thermal conduction structure eliminates the trade-off between high photo-thermal conversion rate and high energy efficiency in solar thermal storage.
WANG2022133026¡Environmentally persistent free radicals in bismuth-based metal–organic layers derivatives: Photodegradation of pollutants and mechanism unravelling¡Environmentally persistent free radicals= Photocatalysis= Metal–organic frameworks¡Formation of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) on carbonaceous material has aroused increasing research attentions. In terms of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) derivatives, however, scarce studies have dedicated to the relevant aspects. Herein, EPFRs have been detected in Bi-metal organic layers (Bi-MOLs) derivatives. The corresponding g-factors and concentrations of EPFRs on Bi2O3@C by pyrolyzed at different temperatures were 2.0041–2.0046 and 7.04 × 1019-1.77 × 1020 spins/g, respectively. Interestingly, similar EPFRs signals were also monitored in HKUST-1 based and UiO-66 based derivatives. We observed that Bi2O3@C system with the highest EPFRs concentration exhibited superior degradation and mineralization efficiency for phenol and tetracycline. Its excellent photocatalytic performance was mainly attributed to the interaction between the internal EPFRs and photoinduced active species, which promoted more generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) radicals. This hypothesis was supported by line correlations for EPFRs concentration vs. degradation kinetics in samples pyrolyzed at different temperatures (R2 = 0.946). Most significantly, mechanism investigation combined with DFT calculation indicated that the EPFRs not only promote the generation of 1O2 and •OH via molecular oxygen activation pathway but also provided a possibility of enhancing water oxidation by holes. These findings pave the way for MOFs derivative's implication and insight into the role of EPFRs in photocatalysis.

Herein, the hollow N-doped carbon nanoflowers (h-N-CFs) with nanosheets subunits were synthesized by using 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxaldehyde (DABA-BTCO) complex nanoflowers as the self-template and nitrogen resource. Various physical characterizations show that h-N-CFs with hollow and porous architecture have a high surface area (1390.3 m2g−1) and abundant activated N atoms (i.e., graphitic N and pyridinic N). Electrochemical measurements demonstrate that h-N-CFs synthesized at 800 °C can be used as an efficient metal-free ORR catalyst with prominent electroactivity and stability due to hollow architecture, abundant pores, and high N-doping content. Meanwhile, h-N-CFs also show eminent ORR selectivity (i.e., methanol tolerance) in alkaline media, which markedly surpasses benchmark Pt/C catalyst in the presence of methanol.

In this work, a multifunctional oxidized poly (arylene sulfide sulfone)/UiO-66 (OPASS-U) nanofibrous membrane was successfully developed via electrospinning technology, which could simultaneously remove the multiple contaminants, such as emulsified oil, organic dyes, and heavy metal ions and exhibit outstanding stability in the corrosive and harsh environment. It is founded that the OPASS-U nanofibrous membrane had large specific surface area, hydrophobicity, and high flux. The OPASS-U nanofibrous membrane was demonstrated to remove oil from both oil/water and water-in-dichloromethane emulsion with high removal efficiency (98.44%) and flux (636 L/m2h). It also represented high adsorption amounts for methylene blue and Cr (VI) with opposite charges and large specific surface area. Meanwhile, the OPASS-U nanofibrous membrane could achieve 99.9% regeneration efficiency after ten cycles of methylene blue removal. More importantly, this membrane maintained an outstanding stable morphology and high removal performance for a variety of contaminants after storing in corrosive and harsh solution, which could be widely utilized in complex wastewater treatment especially under harsh environment.

Such distinctive nanostructures develop the advance heterostructures with carbon decorating can remarkably accelerate electron transfer and ionic diffusion kinetics while guarantee the structural integrity upon sodium ion storage. With these merits, the Cu2S@ZnS/C nanohybrid exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance with a high reversible capacity of 352 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1 and long cycle stability with 94.7% capacity retention after 1000 cycles. Electrochemical kinetic analysis and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the decreased ions diffusion energy barrier for expediting electrochemical kinetics. Of note, the proof-of-concept 3D printed sodium ion batteries have been set up by coupling the 3D printed Cu2S@ZnS/C anode with 3D printed Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, which are capable of delivering high and stable capacity output.

The hydrogel can be recycled and reprocessed into any desired shape and can withstand the maximum tensile stress of about 23 MPa, the maximum fracture energy is as high as 7592 J/m2. The hydrogels exhibit strain hardening behavior at low strain. In addition, the high strength can be maintained stably for more than 60 days in an aqueous environment and the hydrogel has pH-induced shape memory property. The hydrogel can be further strengthened by the introduction of zinc ions, and its toughness and elongation at break are greatly improved, which is mainly based on the dynamic balance between free zinc ions and conjunct zinc ions in the gel. In addition, the introduction of zinc ions also greatly improves the electrical conductivity of the gel. The strain sensor prepared by this gel has high sensitivity, good linear response, and stability, and is expected to be a promising candidate material for flexible electronic products and strain sensors.
WU2022133062¡Full-visible-spectrum lighting enabled by site-selective occupation in the high efficient and thermal stable (Rb, K)2CaPO4F: Eu2+ solid-solution phosphors¡Full-visible-spectrum= (Rb=K)CaPOF: Eu= Site-selective occupation¡Tuning the luminescent properties of phosphors by crystal-site engineering is a good and efficient strategy for developing high-quality white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs). However, it is still challenging to modulate the cyan to red spectral emission in a single matrix and activator phosphor to obtain multicolor output and achieve full-visible-spectrum lighting. Herein, the strategy to manipulate site-selective occupation of Eu2+ activators by substituting the cation Rb+ with K+ is reported to obtain a versatile color output. The large-scale redshift regulation of emission spectrum from cyan to red was achieved in fluor-phosphate Rb2-yKyCaPO4F: 0.0085Eu2+ (R2-yKyCPOF: 0.0085Eu2+) (0 ≤ y ≤ 1.8) phosphors, which is designed by using Rb2CaPO4F: 0.0085Eu2+ (RCPOF: 0.0085Eu2+) cyan-emitting phosphor. The redistribution of Eu2+ ions in Rb1, Rb2, and Ca sites is achieved by introducing the cation K+ to substitute Rb+, and R2-yKyCPOF: 0.0085Eu2+ (0 ≤ y ≤ 1.8) is kept in the pure phase. Furthermore, the mixed phosphors of RCPOF: 0.0085Eu2+, RKCPOF: 0.0085Eu2+, and R0.2K1.8CPOF: 0.0085Eu2+ show excellent optical performance and good thermal stability. Full-visible spectrum lighting is successfully achieved with the combination of a 395 nm NUV chip and the blend of phosphor-converted WLEDs. The K+ substitution reported in this paper can support a project for warm WLEDs by manipulating the distribution of Eu2+ activator among different cation sites.
HANMANDLU2022132831¡Few-layer fluorine-functionalized graphene hole-selective contacts for efficient inverted perovskite solar cells¡Charge-selective contacts can play a critical role in enhancing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this study, we employed fluorine-functionalized graphene (FGr) layers having finely tunable energy levels as hole transport layers (HTLs) to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of inverted PSCs. The non-wetting surface of the FGr enhanced the crystallinity of organic–inorganic perovskites films with large aspect ratios, relative to that of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). Combining the high work function of the HTL interface with the enhanced crystallinity and limited grain boundary area dramatically decreased the charge recombination losses in organic–inorganic trihalide perovskite (OTP) films. Thus, when incorporating FGr HTLs in inverted PSCs, the best PCE reached 19.34%—the highest efficiency reported to date for any PSC featuring a functionalized graphene HTL. Furthermore, we used this HTL to prepare flexible PSCs and obtained a highest efficiency of 17.50%. Therefore, this highly applicable and facile interface strategy using functionalized graphene HTLs provides stable PSCs displaying high PCEs.
MILH2022132875¡Degradation of sulfamethoxazole by ferrous iron activated peroxymonosulfate: Elucidation of the degradation mechanism and influence of process parameters¡Ferrous iron activation= Peroxymonosulfate= Sulfamethoxazole= Degradation pathway¡In this research, the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) by ferrous iron (Fe2+) was investigated as a technique for the degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX). First, the influence of the Fe2+:PMS molar ratio on the obtained degradation efficiency was investigated and an excess of Fe2+ was found to result in a decrease in SMX degradation efficiency, while, for the investigated molar ratios, an excess of PMS was found to enhance the degradation efficiency. To obtain a higher degradation efficiency, the dosing strategy of the reagents was altered: from direct dosing (introducing the reagents all at once) to sequential dosing (adding the same total amount of reagent, but divided over specific time intervals) and continuous dosing (adding the same total amount of reagent, but continuously over 30 min reaction time). Continuous dosing of both Fe2+ and PMS was found to be the optimal strategy, with a SMX degradation efficiency of 67% in 50 min reaction time. By performing scavenging experiments, the reactive species (•OH, •SO4- and Fe(IV) present in this process were identified. It was found that the contribution of •OH to the degradation of SMX increased when changing from direct to continuous dosing. Lastly, the formed degradation products were identified, and differences in reaction pathway depending on the reactive species present were elucidated.
ZUO2022132996¡A high areal capacity solid-state zinc-air battery via interface optimization of electrode and electrolyte¡Zinc-air battery= High areal capacity= Interface optimization= Porous zinc electrode¡Solid-state zinc-air batteries (SZABs) are regarded as a promising energy source for next-generation wearable electronic devices due to their high theoretical energy density and reliability. However, practical development of solid-state zinc-air batteries is hindered by the low specific areal capacity and poor contact between solid-state electrolyte and electrode caused by zinc passivation and electrolyte aging. Herein, we report a new strategy for optimizing the solid-state electrolyte/electrode interface coupling by combining porous zinc electrode and thermal-sensitive solid-state electrolyte F127 to improve the areal-capacity of solid-state zinc-air batteries. The porous Zn anode prepared by zinc electrodeposition on the zinc substrate is used to alleviate zinc passivation and improve the specific area capacity of SZAB. In addition, to enhance the contact between the solid-state electrolyte and the zinc anode, the F127 surfactant is selected as the solid-state electrolyte due to its fluidity at low temperatures. Benefiting from the porous structure and excellent contact, the SZAB using porous zinc anode and the solid-state electrolyte F127 exhibits high areal capacity of 133 mAh cm−2 at the current density of 4 mA cm−2, which is 100 times higher than that of the solid zinc-air battery using zinc foil as the anode. Moreover, the results show that the use of porous zinc electrodes is conducive to achieving high current discharge, which is critical for the practical application of solid-state zinc-air batteries.
CHEN2022133036¡Anisotropic hydrogels with enhanced mechanical and tribological performance by magnetically oriented nanohybrids¡Anisotropic hydrogels= Magnetic nanoparticles= Montmorillonite= Mechanical properties¡Most current hydrogels have weak mechanical properties and unordered structures, which limits their applications. However, soft tissues with highly ordered hierarchical nanocomposite structures exhibit anisotropic mechanical performance and function to adapt the complex environments. Therefore, the introduction of an ordered nanocomposite structure into hydrogel is an effective strategy to endow the hydrogel with superb mechanical strength and excellent anisotropic functions. Here, we develop a method to create anisotropic hydrogels with significantly enhanced mechanical and tribological properties. Based on mussel adhesion chemistry, polydopamine (PDA) was used as a mediator to control the formation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of montmorillonite (MMT). Subsequently, the obtained PDA-Fe3O4-MMT nanohybrids in the polyvinyl alcohol/polyacrylic acid (PVA/PAA) hydrogel matrix were aligned to form an ordered structure using magnetic-induced technology and then frozen in hydrogel form by freezing-thawing and annealing methods. The resulting hydrogels showed an anisotropic microstructure and exhibited outstanding mechanical properties with a tensile strength of 10.65 MPa, toughness of 52.2 MJ/m3, and compressive strength of 4.86 MPa, which is higher than that of the corresponding isotropic hydrogel. More interestingly, the friction coefficient of hydrogel is significantly reduced to as low as 0.038 due to the presence of ordered structure. This work not only improves magnetic induction technology for the preparation of anisotropic hydrogels but also provides a simple and effective method to obtain hydrogels with anisotropic structure, high mechanical strength, and anisotropic properties for potential application in tissue engineering.
YAO2022133020¡Carbon sources driven supernatant micro-particles differentiate in submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs)¡Anaerobic membrane bioreactors= Micro-particles= Carbon source= Microbial community¡Recently, micro-particles with a size range of 0.45–10 μm in anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs), were rich in microorganisms and characterized as a significant source to membrane fouling. Nevertheless, little is known about the formation of the micro-particles associated microorganisms as well as their metabolic functions, which could be largely impacted by carbon sources in the influent. Here, protein and glucose were chosen to be two different carbon sources fed into two identical AnMBRs (i.e., AnMBR-P and AnMBR-G), and a comprehensive comparison of the micro-particles formed in corresponding reactors was made. Size-dependent fractionation and fluorescent staining assay showed that micro-particles with the size range of 0.45–1 μm possessed the highest contents (41.4%) in the AnMBR-P and presented as vibrios and coccus, while the 5–10 μm micro-particles with filamentous morphologies were the prevailing fraction (61.9%) in the AnMBR-G. According to the results of high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the Lentimicrobiaceae, D8A-2 and Syntrophorhabdus prevailed in the AnMBR-P micro-particles, while the SJA-15 showed overwhelming predominance than the other genera in the AnMBR-G micro-particles. Metagenomic sequencing further revealed that the micro-particles in the AnMBR-P possessed higher abundance in specific functional genes for nitrogen metabolism (nirB), sulfur metabolism (cysK) and cysteine and methionine metabolism (mtaD), as well as in the cell mobility as chemotaxis (rbsB) and flagellar assembly (fliC). In comparison, the micro-particles obtained from the AnMBR-G encoded abundant genes for converting glucose to metabolites in the next level, such as glk (glucokinase), pfk (ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase), and PGK (phosphoglycerate kinase). Overall, our findings provided new insights into the formation of micro-particles in the supernatant of AnMBRs, which could facilitate to propose related fouling alleviation methods from the perspective of carbon sources regulation and/or pretreatment of the influent.
LI2022133049¡Quasi-commercial production of SnS-based nanosheets with enhanced thermoelectric performance via a wet chemical synthesis¡Thermoelectric material= Tin sulfide= Nanosheet= Carrier concentration¡Tin sulfide (SnS) is a low-cost, earth-abundant, and eco-friendly thermoelectric (TE) material whose layered orthorhombic structure is similar to that of SnSe; however, current studies on SnS are limited because of its difficult synthesis due to the use of volatile sulfur, and its thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) is also low because of its intrinsically low electrical conductivity. Herein, we present a facile wet chemical synthesis to prepare uniform and well-dispersed SnS nanosheet crystals. Low-rate initial production with 3.5 L solvent was performed to obtain high-quality crystals, and also to adapt the process to commercial preparation. The carrier concentrations were enhanced from 3.2×1018 cm−3 to 4.8×1019 cm−3 (at 873 K) step-by-step via increasing Sn vacancies, adding SnSe, and embedding Ag atoms. The maximum power factor (PF) at 873 K of 0.48×10−3 W⋅m−1K−2 was achieved in the selenium-silver co-doped sample, which presented a state-of-the-art value for the polycrystalline SnS. Correspondingly, the lattice thermal conductivities (κL) decreased from 0.8 W⋅m−1K−1 to 0.47 W⋅m−1K−1 (at 873 K) due to enhanced phonon scattering. The highest zT was 0.80 at 873 K, which is about 5 or 6 times higher than those of the pristine SnS(1:1) or SnS(1:0.8) samples. These findings provide a novel method to prepare high-quality and high-performance TE semiconductors via a wet chemical synthesis.
GUO2022132984¡Magnetically anchored antibody-coupled nanocomposite as α-Amylase inhibitor for long-time protection against glycemic variability¡IgY= Immune response= Nanoparticle= Diabetes¡Glycemic variability is an important risk factor for metabolic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases, which are closely related to life and diet style. Random eating or eating irregular meals and poor patient compliance with lifestyle changes often happens and makes more difficult to control glycemic variability in life through hypoglycemic drugs around meals. The inhibition of the activity of digestion enzymes in the gut represents an effective strategy for prevention and treatment of glycemic variability. In this study, immune response was employed to induce antibodies (immunoglobulin of egg yolk, IgY) against α-amylase through the subcutaneous injection of α-amylase as the antigen in laying hens. IgY-coupled magnetic nanocomposite hydrogel as α-amylase inhibitor was further developed for long-time against glycemic variability. IgY was covalently coupled to PEG-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles (PEG/Fe3O4@IgY nanoparticles) and then fabricated by embedding of PEG/Fe3O4@IgY nanoparticles in chitosan-alginate (CS/AS) hydrogels. Under the external magnetic field, lgY-coupled magnetic nanocomposites as α-amylase inhibitors were magnetically anchored in the small intestine for long-time against glycemic variability, resulting in a long-time (>36 h) and effective postprandial hyperglycemia management. This study opens a new door to the health care of the metabolic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease.
WANG2022133065¡Hydrophobic π-conjugated organic small molecule as a multi-functional interface material enables efficient and stable perovskite solar cells¡Perovskite Solar Cell= Stability= π-conjugated¡Surface treatment of perovskite films with interface materials is an effective strategy to resolve trap-mediated nonradiative recombination toward high efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, interface materials for multi-functional treatment have been rarely investigated in PSCs. In this work, a novel pyrene-based organic material (TAAPyr) is first introduced as a defect passivation layer and a protect layer against moisture for PSCs application. With the TAAPyr interfacial modification, both perovskite surface defects and nonradiative recombination are effectively decreased as well as the carrier transport in device is also enhanced, As a consequence, the best power conversion efficiencies (PCE) up to 22.45% for TAAPyr-based device was obtained, clearly outperforming the control one (20.37%). Moreover, it was found that the π-conjugated TAAPyr can promote intermolecular face-to-face stacking on the surface perovskite film, which is favorable to making the perovskite surface more hydrophobic and consequently enhance PSCs long-term stability. The un-encapsulated PSCs can retain 92% of the initial PCE after storage for 600 h at ∼65% RH, in comparison with 64% efficiency retention of the device without TAAPyr under the same conditions. This work presents a new strategy to enhance the efficiency and stability of PSCs by multi-functional π–conjugated passivator.
DOU2022132842¡A defect-rich layered double hydroxide nanofiber filter with solar-driven regeneration for wastewater treatment¡Wastewater treatment= Defect-rich layered double hydroxide= Solar-driven regeneration= 3D filter modelling simulation¡The need for environmental technology treatment of contaminants of emerging concerns (CECs) is increasing as CECs lead to detrimental effects on human health and ecosystems. Herein, defect-rich layered double hydroxide (LDH) structured into a fibrous filter with a facile solar-driven regeneration function was fabricated for efficiently removing adsorbed CECs in wastewater. The physical and chemical interactions between the LDH filter and CECs are revealed. It is demonstrated that the introduction of unsaturated Cuδ+ sites (δ < 2) and creating oxygen vacancies represents an effective way for improving adsorbing activity of the defect-rich LDH host layer. Also, the nanofiber-particle friction coefficient of the hierarchical LDH filter affects the filtration efficiency as revealed by 3D modelling. The LDH filter is capable of filtrating sixteen types of CECs and shows the capability of photocatalytic degradation of adsorbed CECs, thus enabling filter regeneration. This work thus presents a new perspective into bottom-up design of adsorbent materials: from molecular interactions to shaping adsorbents into microscopic nanofibers and assembling these into macroscopic 3D adsorbent filters.
SHIM2022133061¡Facile morphology control strategy to enhance charge separation efficiency of Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes for efficient photoelectrochemical water splitting¡Photoelectrochemical water splitting= Bismuth vanadate= Photoanode= Nanostructuring¡Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is one of the promising earth-abundant semiconducting materials for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, BiVO4 suffers from poor charge separation efficiency due to its low carrier mobility and short minority carrier diffusion length. Nanostructured BiVO4 photoanodes provide a simple way to improve charge separation efficiency. Here, we propose a facile nanostructuring strategy for enhancing the PEC performance of molybdenum-doped BiVO4 (Mo:BiVO4) photoanodes by varying the molecular weight of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a pore former. It was demonstrated that the grain and pore sizes of Mo:BiVO4 could be controlled by changing the molecular weight of PEG. Nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes with optimized grain and pore sizes revealed an effective charge separation efficiency of 72% and showed the highest photocurrent density of 2.2 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE). After hydrogen treatment and decoration of nickel iron (oxy)hydroxide (NiFeOOH) as an oxygen evolution catalyst, a stable photocurrent density of 4.5 mA cm−2 with a 10-h duration was achieved at 1.23 VRHE under standard 1-sun illumination. Our findings clearly suggest new insights on a simple strategy to improve the PEC performance of nanostructured Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes.
LI2022132980¡Kinetics on 1,3-butadiene dimerization by the cycloaddition reactions in high pressure and high temperature micro-reactor¡1=3-butadiene= Dimerization= Cycloaddition reaction= Diels-Alder reaction= Kinetics¡The kinetics of 1,3-butadiene dimerization based on the cycloaddition reactions including Diels-Alder reaction under high temperature and high pressure were investigated in a microchannel reactor. Our findings suggest that the butadiene dimerization produced 4-vinyl-cyclohexene (VCH) and 1,5-cyclooctadiene (COD). The results indicate that COD can only be formed under high temperature conditions. The apparent kinetic parameters of butadiene dimerization under high pressure were obtained by fitting experimental data. As the reaction pressure increased, the reaction rate in the solution was found to increase slightly. Compared with the gas phase dimerization of butadiene in the literature, it can be concluded that the reaction rate constants in the liquid phase are greater than that in the gas phase. To our best knowledge, this is the first work reporting the kinetic parameters of butadiene dimerization with the radical polymerization excluded under high pressure liquid phase condition.
CHEN2022132952¡Efficient nitrate and perchlorateremoval from aqueous solution via a novel electro-dialysis ion-exchange membrane bioreactor¡Perchlorate= Nitrate= Electro-dialysis ion-exchange membrane bioreactor= Kinetics¡The performance of a novel Electro-dialysis ion-exchange membrane bioreactor (EDIMB) for simultaneous removal of perchlorate and nitrate from aqueous solution was studied. EDIMB combines electrodialysis (ED) with bioreduction to remove contaminants while avoiding secondary contamination of organic matter and microorganisms. The removal process of pollutants in water compartment and bio-compartment can be well simulated by the First-order kinetic model and the established Zero-Michaelis-Menten model. Furthermore, compared with ED (VSS = 0.00 g/L), when the microbial concentration was 3.00 g/L, the total current efficiency was increased by 43.5% in first 60 min. The biological reaction takes place in the bio-compartment, which reduces the resistance of pollutant transmembrane migration and promotes ion migration. Microorganisms played a promoting role in the process of pollutant migration. High-throughput sequencing analysis of microorganisms showed that Thauera and Macellibacteroides were the main denitrifying and perchlorate-reducing bacteria.
CAI2022132931¡Self-supported VN arrays coupled with N-doped carbon nanotubes embedded with Co nanoparticles as a multifunctional sulfur host for lithium-sulfur batteries¡Transition metal nitrides= Multifunctional= Sulfur hosts= Flexible¡Rational design and synthesis of advanced sulfur host materials has been regarded as an effective strategy to address the critical challenges of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries including shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), sluggish reaction kinetics, and huge volume change of sulfur. In this work, we demonstrate the rational construction of a multifunctional sulfur host grown on carbon cloth consisting of self-supported porous VN arrays coupled with MOF-derived N-doped carbon nanotubes embedded with tiny Co nanoparticles (named CC/VN/Co@NCNTs). This unique electrode design possesses a series of advantages such as high electrical conductivity, strong physical/chemical confinement of LiPSs, favorable catalytic activity, fast reaction kinetics, effective volumetric accommodation, good mechanical stability and high sulfur loading. As expected, when evaluated as self-standing and binder-free cathode for Li-S batteries, the CC/VN/Co@NCNTs/S exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1130.4 mAh g−1 at 0.1C and maintains 864.1 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles, along with outstanding rate performance (625.3 mAh g−1 at 5C) and superior long-term cycling stability with a low capacity decay rate of 0.063% per cycle at 1C for 500 cycles. Moreover, the CC/VN/Co@NCNTs/S delivers high reversible capacities of 847.6, 668.3, and 581.1 mAh g−1 at 0.1C after 100 cycles at different high sulfur loadings of 2.8, 5.2, and 7.8 mg cm−2, respectively. The present work might provide an effective strategy to directly construct multifunctional sulfur host materials on current collectors for high-performance Li-S batteries.
XU2022133014¡Modification of PEDOT:PSS towards high-efficiency OLED electrode via synergistic effect of carboxy and phenol groups from biomass derivatives¡PEDOT= Conductivity= Bio-based modifier= Efficiency¡Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):Poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) emerges as a promising transparent conducting electrode to replace indium tin oxide (ITO) in the field of optoelectronic devices. It is a pending issue that how to achieve high-conductivity PEDOT:PSS to meet the requirement as device electrode. In this work, two biomass-derived modifiers of PEDOT:PSS, i.e., protocatechuic acid (PA) and gentianic acid (GtA), were investigated. The resultant conductivity was respectively estimated as 2022 S/cm (PA-treated) and 2270 S/cm (GtA-treated), in comparison with that of the ordinarily prepared film (∼0.9 S/cm). By analyzing the PEDOT/PSS ratio, phase morphology, as well as benzenoid/quinoid conformation, crystalline structure, the mechanism on conductivity enhancement was systematically elucidated. Based on the density functional theory, the synergistic effect of carboxy and phenol groups was verified as the origin of excellent doping-efficiency of these two biomass-derived modifiers. What is more, an ITO-free OLED device was successfully fabricated, where the PA or GtA-treated PEDOT:PSS was employed as transparent conducting electrode. Surprisingly, a remarkable improvement with regard to device performance was observed, in spite of the not good enough conductivity relative to ITO. Using the PA/GtA-modified electrodes, the external quantum efficiency (EQE), current efficiency, and power efficiency of OLED devices is elevated by 50–300% at the brightness of 100 cd/m2 for electronic display application. To reveal the underlying mechanism, the energy levels and the light extraction were examined and then ascribed to the paradox. The findings present a possible strategy to construct high-efficiency OLEDs relying on organic transparent electrodes and a promising application of biomass-derived chemicals.
HUANG2022132986¡Self-assembly monomolecular engineering towards efficient and stable inverted perovskite solar cells¡Perovskite solar cells= Triphenylamine derivatives= Energy level matching¡Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with monolayer-modified anodes are promising for high efficiency and stability devices with simplified configuration. Though preliminary studies on modified anodes by small organic molecules were reported, the goal-directed design and regulation of such compounds have been sparsely reported so far, thus limiting device performances. Herein, D-o-D type triphenylamine derivatives with non-conjugated linkage of sp3 oxygen are proposed to finely tune the energy level alignment and enhance the defect passivation at the ITO/perovskite interface, thus facilitating the efficient charge extraction at the anodes. The optimized molecules considerably ameliorate the photovoltaic performances of the corresponding inverted PSCs, engendering a preeminent power-conversion-efficiency (PCE) of 20.57% with negligible hysteresis. Remarkably, a good long-term stability is recorded for the unencapsulated device with over 94% of the initial PCE maintained after 180 days storage in N2 condition. Those improved performances validate the feasibility of the D-o-D molecules for cost-effective PSCs with high-efficiency, and excellent long-term stability.
CHEN2022132983¡Leveraging tumor cell ferroptosis for colorectal cancer treatment via nanoelicitor-activated tumoricidal immunity¡Ferroptosis= Glutathione peroxidase 4= Lipid peroxidation= Immunotherapy¡Ferroptosis is an iron- and reactive oxygen species-dependent form of regulated cell death with great clinical translational potential for cancer treatment, however, the efficacy of ferroptosis-elicitable agents is susceptible to many an inhibitory endogenous mediator in vivo. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a central regulator of lipid peroxidation, was found signigicantly up-regulated in colorectal tumors, which inhibits tumor cell ferroptosis. To leverage ferroptosis combating colorectal cancer, here we report a Hypoxia-responsive nanoelicitor (HRNE) for promoting lipid peroxidation and thus facilitating ferroptosis by relieving GPX4-mediated brake. By self-assembling of immune-elicitable polyphenols, Chlorogenic acid (CA) and Mitoxantrone (MIT), with Fe3+ ions, the self-deliverable nanoelicitors were constructed and then cloaked with a hypoxia-responsive hybrid liposomal membrane. In the hypoxic tumor, the liposomal shell discomposed and the nanoelicitor was burst released. Ferroptosis-inducible Fe2+ accompanied with toxic reactive oxygen species was produced via Fenton reaction. An activated tumoricidal immunity was simultaneously co-stimulated by MIT and CA, through which the system xc− to GPX4 pathway was aborted, and the facilitated lipid peroxidation in turn promoted the iron-initiated tumor cell damage. We highlight the nanoelicitor significantly attenuated the GPX4-mediated inhibition of lipid peroxidation by activating a robust tumoricidal immunity and thus synergistically potentiated cancer cell ferroptosis.
MENG2022133044¡In-situ construction of edge site-enriched VS4/graphene hybrids toward high-performance lithium storage¡ construction= Electroactive edge sites= Amorphous phase transition¡In-situ construction of edge site-enriched transition metal sulfides coupled graphene hybrids holds an effective strategy for high-performance lithium-ion storage. Here, a hybrid architecture with edge site-enriched VS4 electroactive species anchored on graphene sheet is tailor-made as an ideal host for Li+ via a simple in-situ assembly process. The etching effect is an indispensable factor in the formation of hybrid structure with ultra-rich edge sites, which makes a positive contribution to the surface-structure activity. The integrated hybrids not only guarantee a high utilization of electroactive species and fast reaction kinetics, but also open up synergistic electrochemical properties. Thus, the optimized VS4/Graphene electrodes exhibit uplifting specific capacity (1220 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1), superb rate (476 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1), and excellent cycling durability (100% maintains over 1000 cycles at 10 A g−1). In addition, an irreversible amorphous transition and redox reaction mechanism in the first cycle have been revealed. This work is expected to expound a feasible strategy for the progress of energy storage system.
KHALIFA2022133096¡Modifying absorption process configurations to improve their performance for Post-Combustion CO2 capture – What have we learned and what is still Missing?¡Post-combustion carbon capture= Novel solvents= Absorption process configurations= Energy saving= Heat integration¡Mitigation of climate change by reducing the anthropogenic CO2 emissions has recently gained huge momentum. A prime pathway to achieve it in the short-medium term lies within capturing CO2 from industries’ flue gases. Post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) is the most mature methodology for large-scale CO2 capture and closest to market. However, the conventional chemical absorption-based PCC process implies high regeneration energy requirements, constituting the majority of the energy load when adding PCC to the plant from which the CO2 is going to be captured. As such, reducing the overall parasitic load of the conventional process is of interest. Changing the solvent or improving the process flowsheet are two main methodologies to achieve higher energetic efficiency and lower exergy losses. As there are several reviews dealing with novel solvents, this review critically evaluates the progress in improving the conventional PCC process through modifications of process configurations and shadowed by solvent replacements as drop-in solutions. The process configurations were grouped into absorption and stripping enhancement categories. A comparative analysis was conducted between the different available schemes in the literature and interactions between solvents and process configurations were showcased, highlighting the advantages and shortcomings of some of them. The review reveals the need for standardized framework and optimization algorithms using exergo-economic performance indicators for integrated solvent and process synthesis.
ROBINSON2022132975¡Unravelling the mechanisms of microwave pyrolysis of biomass¡Pyrolysis= Microwave= Biomass= Mass transfer¡This study uses empirical observations and mass transfer simulations to establish a new mechanism for microwave pyrolysis of biomass. Experiments were conducted on cellulose and hemicellulose, using microwave equipment that could vary the observed heating rate. No microwave-absorbing additives were used. At high heating rates it is shown categorically that microwave pyrolysis can significantly reduce the pyrolysis temperatures for hemicellulose and cellulose, but when microwave heating is used to deliver a low heating rate the pyrolysis behaviour is identical to that obtained with conventional heating. Dielectric properties are shown to vary by over an order of magnitude depending on the heating rate. The implications of heating rate on mass transfer and phase behaviour are developed and discussed within the paper, with liquid-phase water identified as a key driver for the observed differences in the microwave pyrolysis process. This is the first study in microwave pyrolysis that is able to reconcile microwave heating phenomena against simple and well-understood mass transfer and phase equilibria effects. As a result, a number of processing strategies have emerged with the potential to use microwave heating to enable more selective pyrolysis and bio-oils with more targeted quality than has been possible with conventional approaches.
YANG2022132999¡Eco-friendly and acid-resistant magnetic porous carbon derived from ZIF-67 and corn stalk waste for effective removal of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam from water¡Adsorption= Magnetic porous carbon= ZIF-67= Corn stalk= Imidacloprid¡Neonicotinoids, extensively present in water environment, can adversely affect the ecological safety and human health. Herein, a low-cost magnetic porous carbon ZIF-67/CS@C derived from ZIF-67 and agricultural waste corn stalk (CS) is designed and applied for adsorptive removal of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam from water. The adsorbent is fabricated by carbonizing ZIF-67/CS hybrid pre-prepared through an in-situ decoration of ZIF-67 on the surface of CS, and then acid picking to elute the unstable constituents. In the carbonization, Co2+ ions are reduced to magnetic Co0 nanoparticles, with the result that ZIF-67/CS@C shows a strong magnetic response (saturation magnetization intensity is 12.25 emu‧g−1) and can be easily magnetically separated. Meanwhile, Co nanoparticles are protectively encapsulated in well-developed graphitized wall, which endows ZIF-67/CS@C with good acid resistance (only 0.23% of Co is leached out at pH 1.0). More importantly, reasonable pore size distribution (most pore sizes match or are 3–6 times that of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam) and high external surface area (280 m2‧g−1) are obtained, which makes ZIF-67/CS@C super adsorbent. The adsorption capacities for imidacloprid and thiamethoxam can reach as high as 189 and 133 mg‧g−1, respectively. Moreover, after six consecutive recycling processes, the adsorption efficiencies are still above 95%, which reveals excellent reusability of ZIF-67/CS@C. Mechanism analysis affirms that pore-filling, H-bond, and π-π EDA interaction are mainly responsible for driving imidacloprid and thiamethoxam adsorption. Finally, ZIF-67/CS@C with a great security towards Daphnia carinata survival and wheat growth is eco-friendly. This study can be easily adapted to different biomass wastes and MOFs, thus potentially enabling the preparation of more novel adsorbents.
WANG2022132971¡Bifunctional composite separator with redistributor and anion absorber for dendrites-free and fast-charging lithium metal batteries¡Li metal battery= Separator= Phase inversion= Dendrite¡Li metal anode has been considered as “Holy Grail” for next-generation high energy density batteries owing to its extremely high theoretical capacity and low potential. However, the growth of Li dendrites caused by the uneven Li deposition would lead to poor electrochemical performance and batteries safety risks, which seriously hinders the practical applications of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a scalable modification with a PVDF-HFP/Y0.08Zr0.92O2-δ composite coating on commercial polypropylene (PP) separators is proposed for dendrites-free Li metal batteries. The porous PVDF-HFP matrix derived by phase inversion can act as a redistributor to regulate Li+ flux, while the oxygen vacancies in Y0.08Zr0.92O2-δ nanoparticles act as anion absorbers to increase the lithium ion transference number which promotes a homogenous Li deposition and fast-charging capability. The synergetic effects of Li redistributor and anion absorber can make LMBs achieve a high average coulombic efficiency (98.4% over 500 cycles), prolonged life span (over 1000 h) and enhanced rate performance (155 mAh g−1 at 10 C). This work provides a feasible strategy for separator modification (e.g. changing the anion absorber to a polysulfide absorber for lithium sulfur batteries) to construct dendrite-free and fast-charging LMBs.
ZAREMBA2022132935¡Concentration on demand – A microfluidic system for precise adjustment of the content of single droplets¡Droplet-based microfluidics= Microfluidic traps= Droplet manipulation= Concentration tuning¡We present a novel microfluidic system that produces the required concentration of a reagent in a single droplet or that produces a sequence of droplets with a defined periodic distribution of concentrations. We use digital algorithms that, through a series of simple operations, such as merging and splitting droplets, ensure superior precision, repeatability and flexibility in concentration setting. Unlike Digital microfluidic (DMF) systems based on electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) commonly used to implement digital algorithms in the droplet world, our approach is based on much more available channel-based microfluidics operated by programmable syringe pumps. Furthermore, the small footprint of our system makes it easy to integrate with other structures of microfluidic networks. Thus, this technique is a comprehensive component that can be built into the microfluidic networks executing laboratory analytical tasks in chemistry or biology to enrich their performance and offer new functionalities.
YU2022132987¡Porous Carbon/Borocarbonitride hybrid with enhanced tap density as a polar host for ultralong life Lithium-Sulfur batteries¡Borocarbonitride= Enhanced tap density= High conductivity= Catalytic activity¡The severe shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics are the current bottlenecks of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, resulting in capacity fading and inferior rate performance, especially under the condition of high sulfur loading and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S). Herein, conductive carbon nanoparticles (Ketjen Black, KB) covered by borocarbonitride (BCN) are assembled into micro-sized particles to form a polar KB@BCN hybrid, which is employed as a sulfur host with enhanced tap density via a facile intergrowth method. At a molecular level, BCN, endowed with abundant adsorption sites as the adsorbent and catalyst, can adsorb polysulfides and catalyze the conversion of polysulfides. On the nanometer scale, the BCN is loaded on the highly conductive KB nanoparticles, which can improve the conductivity of the hybrid (1786 S m−1), thereby improving the conversion of polysulfides. On the micrometer scale, the BCN and the KB nanoparticles together form micro-sized particles to improve the tap density, which is beneficial to build thick electrodes and reduce the amount of electrolyte. When applied as a sulfur cathode, KB@BCN-2 shows good cycling capability (a low-capacity decay of 0.05% after 800 cycles at 0.5C) and high rate performance (765 mA h g−1 at 3.0C). Even under a lean electrolyte condition (E/S = 5 μL mg−1), the KB@BCN-2-S has a high initial capacity of 1266 mA h g−1 at 0.1C. Significantly, incorporating polar electrocatalysts with carbon matrix to form a high-density sulfur host through secondary granulation can provide a new insight for achieving high-performance Li-S batteries.
LEE2022132891¡A recyclable indoor air filter system based on a photocatalytic metal–organic framework for the removal of harmful volatile organic compounds¡Indoor Air Quality= Volatile Organic Compounds= Filter System= Photocatalytic Decomposition¡Adsorption/removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) has become essential for indoor air quality management because of their harmful effect on the human body. In this study, we report on an indoor VOC filter system using a photocatalytic metalorganic framework (MOF) filter (PMF) based on MIL-100(Fe) with a particle size of ∼ 160 nm. The PMF was prepared by the electrophoretic deposition of MOF nanoparticles on a porous nickel foam. The MOF nanoparticles were uniformly coated on a large-sized conductive Nickel foam (up to a 10 cm diameter) without uncoated metal foam. To evaluate the adsorption/removal performance of VOCs on the developed PMF, a testbed system, including a photoionization detector, a carbon dioxide sensor, an ultraviolet (UV) light-emitting diode module, and a fan module, was developed, and a filter system was set up. The fabricated PMF showed excellent adsorption and decomposition of the adsorbed VOCs under UV light due to the high specific surface area and photocatalytic property of MIL-100(Fe). The average adsorption and removal performances of the PMF for 10 experiments were 94.25% and 75.95%, respectively. In the durability test, the PMF indicated 72.65% removal efficiency after conducting recycling tests 50 times, and the structure of the PMF was stable. Our approach provides an easy method for preparing MOF-based photocatalytic filters for use in an indoor VOC purification system. We believe that the prepared PMF has good stability and durability for VOC removal and can be applied to various applications such as home, automobile, office, and industry.
ZHANG2022132832¡Metallated terpolymer donors with strongly absorbing iridium complex enables polymer solar cells with 16.71% efficiency¡Polymer donors= Terpolymer strategy= Iridium complexation¡With the sharp growth of non-fullerene acceptors, it is still challenging to develop new polymer donors for highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here, a series of metallated terpolymer donors PM6Irx (x = 1%, 3%, 5%) are synthesized by incorporating a new iridium complex, named M1, into the backbone of the state-of-the-art polymer PM6. The M1 shows a strong absorption in the visible region, which is beneficial to enhance photon harvesting in the active layer. The PM6Ir1:Y6 based PSCs exhibit the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.71% with short-circuit current density (JSC) of 26.16 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.848 V and fill factor (FF) of 75.33%. A PCE improvement of about 7% is achieved compared with PM6Ir0:Y6 based control device with PCE of 15.65%, which is due to the markedly increased JSC and FF. The introduction of a moderate amount of M1 enhances the photon harvesting, triplet excitons and lifetime, charge mobility as well as optimizes the active layer morphology. This work indicates that iridium complexes with strong absorption in the visible region have a great potential to promote the photovoltaic performance.
LI2022132985¡Stabilizing reaction interface in Ni-rich layered oxides cathode for high-performance lithium-ion batteries at a high cutoff voltage¡Lithium-ion batteries= Cathode materials= Nickel-rich layered oxide= Surface modification¡Nickel-rich layered oxide materials have been considered as promising cathodes for Li-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high electrochemical capacities and low costs. However, the capacity fading and voltage decay during the cycle at high voltage hinders its practical application, resulting from the surface instability and bulk structural transformation. Here, we constructed a high-voltage-stable interface of Lin(TM)mPO4 (LTMPO, TM = Ni, Co, and Mn) by surface treatment to improve the voltage and capacity stability of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) during cycling. The formed LTMPO nanolayer with better ionic conductivity and bonds with the surface of host NCM811 by a TM-O-P bond. As a result, the formed LTMPO interface could suppress the occurrence of surface side reactions and oxygen evolution, thus stabilizing the host structure and surface structure. The surface-modified NHP-2 electrode shows excellent capacity retention of 80.36% over 300 cycles at a high cut-off voltage of 4.5 V. This structure design strategy can effectively improve the electrochemical performance of NCM811 cathodes and promote the rapid development of high energy density Li-ion batteries (LIBs).
ZHANG2022132974¡The mechanisms of interfacial charge transfer and photocatalysis reaction over Cs3Bi2Cl9 QD/(BiO)2CO3 heterojunction¡Perovskite quantum dot= CsBiCl= (BiO)CO= Heterojunction¡We report a series of Cs3Bi2Cl9/(BiO)2CO3 (labeled as C-B-X, X = 0.5, 1, 3) heterojunctions synthesized by the ectopic precipitation method. Density functional theory calculation cooperated with experimental results reveals the high-efficiency electron transport between (BiO)2CO3 and Cs3Bi2Cl9, resulting in an internal electric field at interfaces and efficiently separating the charge carriers, thus promoting more photo-induced charge to participate in the photocatalytic process. Electron spin resonance results unveil a higher amount of OH and O2− formation on C-B-1 heterojunction benefited from the highly efficient charge delivery under visible light irradiation. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy studies verify the effective improvement in NO adsorption/activation and reaction intermediates conversion after constructing the hybrid interface. These factors synergistically enable the NO purification rate of C-B-1 higher than (BiO)2CO3 by 35.0%. This endeavor gives original insights into the mechanism of interfacial charge separation in perovskite quantum dot-based heterogeneous structures and provides a new perspective for promoting safe and potent air pollution control with photocatalytic technology.
XIONG2022132982¡Thermal self-regulatory smart biosensor based on horseradish peroxidase-immobilized phase-change microcapsules for enhancing detection of hazardous substances¡Smart biosensor= Phase-change microcapsules= Thermal self-regulation= Layer-by-layer microstructure= Electrochemical biosensing¡Conventional enzyme-based biosensors are highly sensitive to operation temperature due to a strong temperature dependency of biocatalytic activity. Aiming to enhance the biosensing detection of hazardous substances at high ambient temperatures, we focused on the design and construction of a thermal self-regulatory smart biosensor through an innovative combination of phase change material (PCM) and bioelectrocatalytic material. A bioelectrocatalytic phase-change microcapsule system was first fabricated by microencapsulating n-eicosane as a PCM core in the TiO2 shell and then depositing polypyrrole (PPy) as an electroactive coating layer on the surface of TiO2 shell, followed by immobilizing horseradish peroxidase on the surface of PPy coating layer through physical adsorption. The resultant microcapsules exhibit a regular spherical morphology and layer-by-layer core–shell microstructure with the desired chemical compositions. The microcapsules not only exhibit a good thermal management ability to perform effective temperature regulation under a latent-heat capacity of approximately 115 J/g, but also reveal high thermal impact resistance and good thermal cycle stability for the long-term thermal management application in biosensors. A working electrode was modified with the microcapsules obtained above and then used to construct an electrochemical biosensing system imparted with a thermal self-regulation capability. With a high sensitivity of 5.571 µA·L·µmol−1·cm−2 and a low detection limit of 5.384 µmol/L at 55 °C, the resultant smart biosensor exhibits a better determination ability to detect catechol as a model hazardous substance at high operation temperatures than conventional biosensors thanks to the in-situ thermal management derived from its n-eicosane core. This study provides a new approach for development of thermal self-regulatory smart biosensors with an enhanced identification capability to detect hazardous substances over a wide range of temperatures.
SHAN2022133055¡Sodium storage in triazine-based molecular organic electrodes: The importance of hydroxyl substituents¡Sodium-ion batteries= Molecular electrodes= Triazine compounds= Structural modulation¡Rational design and synthesis of novel organic electrodes have captured growing attention for the development of sustainable sodium ion batteries (SIBs), but the battery performance has been significantly limited by poor reversible specific capacity and cycling ability. Here, we report a simple structural modulation approach for creating a new type of triazine compounds as anode materials displaying superior SIB performance. We find that trihydroxyphenyl functionalities conjugated with the triazine ring enhance electrochemical affinities for Na-ion trapping, thereby promoting reversible Na-ion insertion/deinsertion. The resultant trihydroxyl-modulated triazine-based anode exhibits an exceptional battery capacity, reaching as high as 650 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 and ranks at the top among all reported molecular SIB electrodes. The simple modulation approach not only enables us to achieve exceptional sodium storage but simultaneously provides a means to extends our understanding of structure–property relationship and facilitate new possibilities for organic SIBs.
WANG2022133027¡High energy release boron-based material with oxygen vacancies promoting combustion¡Boron= Molybdenum trioxide= High energy release= Oxygen vacancy¡Boron has a high calorific value and good application prospects in energetic materials. However, further applications of boron are hindered by its incomplete combustion. MoO3 has good catalytic properties, and its layered structure can provide good ion flow channels and embedding positions. In this study, mechanical mixtures of B/MoO3 and B/Mo were prepared. The promotion of B combustion by MoO3 and Mo was confirmed via combustion heat and burning rate tests. The mechanism by which Mo/MoO3 promote B combustion was studied by thermal analysis, high-temperature in situ X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The maximum heat release and burning rate of B/MoO3 and B/Mo were 2.49 and 2.62 and 2.67 and 2.55 times, respectively, those of raw boron. A pre-ignition reaction occurred when boron first came into contact with the surface of MoO3. The oxygen vacancies on the MoO3 surface served as reaction sites for boron. MoO3 promoted the combustion of B by opening up oxygen channels and improving the oxygen transport capability. Mo also effectively promoted boron combustion. B/Mo and B/MoO3 have promising future applications as high energy release materials.
JING2022133009¡Numerical studies on the hydraulic and mixing performances of fluid flow around a cylinder in microchannel with vertical flexible flag¡Micromixer= Flexible flag= Fluid–structure interaction= Mixing efficiency¡Oscillating flexible flag due to the force exerted by periodic flow behind a cylinder is a significant technique to enhance mixing. To analyze its hydraulic and mixing performances, this paper numerically studies the pressure drop and mixing efficiency of fluid flow in a microchannel mounted with a cylinder and vertical flexible flag (CCFF) with different height and deformability in a wide range of Reynolds number Red based on the cylinder diameter. The simple channel without cylinder and flag (SC) and the channel with cylinder and rigid flag (CCRF) are also studied as comparisons. It is found that the mixing within CCFF occurs mainly due to the molecular diffusion at small and moderate Red, and its pressure drop and mixing efficiency increase with the increasing flag height. At large Red, the mixing in CCFF is highly enhanced by the vortices detached from the vibrating flag, and its pressure drop and mixing efficiency first increase and then reach a slight decrease or quasi-steady value with the increasing flag height. Compared with SC, the pressure drop of CCFF is always larger than that of SC, however, the mixing efficiency of CCFF is larger than that of SC only when Red or the flexible flag height is large enough. Comparing with CCRF, the pressure drop and mixing efficiency of CCFF are close to or smaller than those of CCRF at small and moderate Red, however, at large Red, CCFF has smaller pressure drop and larger mixing efficiency, and the maximum decrease of pressure drop could be up to 61.09% and the maximum increase of mixing efficiency could be up to 11.46% compared with CCRF.
LI2022132998¡Non-Destructive characterisation of coke deposit on FCC catalyst and its transient evolution upon Air-Firing and Oxy-Fuel regeneration¡Carbon NEXAFS= FCC catalyst= Coke= Regeneration¡In this paper, the regeneration and associated transient evolution of a commercial FCC spent catalyst in both air-firing and oxy-fuel combustion modes (i.e. 0–10% O2 in N2 or CO2, 510–1000°C, and ∼ 4 sec) were studied in a lab-scale drop-tube furnace. A variety of non-destructive techniques including synchrotron NEXAFS, XPS and ATR-FTIR for both non-grounded and grounded spent catalyst and its combustion residues were employed to reveal the speciation, spatial distribution of coke within the catalyst matrix, as well as its evolution upon rapid heart-up and combustion. As have been confirmed, the coke species is highly broad in speciation, covering aliphatic and aromatic compounds as well as graphite that are both physically deposited and chemically adsorbed on acid sites on the catalyst’s exterior surface. The majority of aliphatic hydrocarbons were also embedded deeply within the catalyst matrix, which were presumably caused by the penetration of precursor molecules that are small in size. Irrespective of the combustion mode, upon the initial rapid heat-up, the embedded light hydrocarbons were rapidly volatilised, and diffused outward toward the exterior surface, where it either underwent C-O2/C-CO2 reactions, or simply further recondensed into graphite in the case that oxygen is lean in the air-firing mode. In contrast, in the oxy-firing mode, the coke was confirmed highly reactive for reverse Boudouard reaction and methane drying reaction which were even triggered during the initial particle heat-up stage. Consequently, the initial graphitisation extent of light vapor was mitigated, and the micro-pores of catalysts were opened up to enable a continuous elution of the hydrocarbon vapors to boost the overall coke burn-off. Regarding the competition of the overall C-O2 and C-CO2 reactions on catalyst exterior surface, the former reaction is superior in the case where oxygen is lean (e.g. 3%). In contrast, when the oxygen content is higher (e.g. 10%), the latter one was intensified due to the strong heat feedback from the exothermic C-O2 reactions. As a result, the overall coke including other two species, graphite and aliphatic hydrocarbons were consumed quickly in the O2/CO2 case.
WANG2022132819¡Precise control of water and wastewater treatment systems with non-ideal heterogeneous mixing models and high-fidelity sensing¡Non-ideal heterogeneous mixing models= Precise Control= Heterogeneity profiling= High-accuracy sensing= Global optimization¡Non-ideal heterogeneous mixing models are developed and incorporated within advanced closed-loop control strategies utilizing high-resolution sensing to maximize the resiliency and minimize the energy consumption of water treatment processes with intelligent model-based decision-making approaches. The proposed non-ideal heterogeneous mixing models capture continuity (heat and mass conservation), yet are extremely simple with few parameters, so they lend themselves to fast online prediction (with extrapolation capabilities) and regular recalibration. Further, they are more accurate than computational fluid dynamics (CFD) (60% less error) and symbolic regression data-driven models (73% less error). Real-time high-resolution sensor data are collected for observing spatiotemporal responses of state variables (conductivity, pH, and temperature) to transient influent shocks. Deterministic global dynamic optimization is used for training and recalibration of the non-ideal heterogeneous mixing models to guarantee the best-possible fits to the sensor data. The models are then deployed within standard model-predictive control and two economic model-predictive control strategies to demonstrate model-based decision-making for disturbance rejection and optimal operation of aeration in a continuous flow nitrification system utilizing high-resolution sensor data from several spatial positions. The new technology platform, consisting of high-resolution sensors, non-ideal heterogeneous mixing modeling, deterministic global dynamic optimization, and model-predictive control, offers superior performance over current approaches in water and wastewater treatment processes.
JI2022133022¡A novel membrane-promoted crystallization process integrating water recovery and salt production for brine management¡Zero-liquid discharge= Membrane-promoted crystallization= Brine management= Capillary forces= Water recovery¡Brine management is one of the global challenges nowadays. Herein, by taking advantage of capillary forces and low-grade heat (50 °C), we propose a novel ceramic membrane-promoted crystallization (MPC) process for brine management. The MPC process simplifies the traditional multiple energy-intensive steps and dispenses the use of expensive anticorrosive equipment via adopting three hierarchical layers (α-Al2O3 substrate, γ-Al2O3 interlayer, and SiO2 top layer). The hydrophilic mesoporous SiO2 top layer provides continuous driving force for brine solution transport from the inner shell of the membrane toward the outer surface, where heterogenous nucleation and secondary nucleation occur to form numerous long needle-like salt whiskers. The growth kinetics of salt whiskers accelerates with time as the formed salt whiskers provide extra evaporation area to intensify water evaporation. Template-directing molecules P123 significantly enhance the specific surface area, pore volume, pore size, and pore regularity of the SiO2 top layer, thereby promoting both water recovery and salt production. The optimized membrane displays high water recovery (790.3 g m−2) and salt production (194.6 g m−2) for high-salinity brine (20 wt%). Moreover, the MPC process demonstrates high performance, mechanical stability and thermal durability during the long-term test. It is expected that the MPC process would provide an innovative zero-liquid discharge approach for the efficient and low-cost brine management.
WANG2022132970¡LiF headspace affixed metallic Li composite enables Li accommodation on the anode surface with excellent electrochemical performance¡Li metal anode= Headspace= Storage space= Li-Zn alloy¡Lithium (Li) metal composite with three-dimensional (3D) skeleton is regarded as the promising anode material for next generation rechargeable high energy batteries. Currently, most of the commercial cathodes are compounds rich of Li elements. In the initial operation of the as-assembled full cell, Li atoms are released from the cathode and directly deposited on the anode surface. The absence of the storage space in the conventional Li composite anode makes Li growth in an uncontrolled way and serious volume fluctuation of the electrode. Herein, LiF headspace affixed Li composite anode is prepared for the first time via a facile one-step thermal fusion method. The storage space constructed by LiF particles is formed on the top surface of 3D Li-LiZn-LiF (LZLF) composite anode, which can accommodate Li deposition from the cathode maintaining structural stability of the anode. Additionally, the LiF particles array on the surface can benefit for fast Li+ diffusion, suppressing Li dendrites growth and inducing uniform Li deposition. In a consequence, the LiF headspace affixed LZLF composite anode shows significantly improved electrochemical performance, i.e., more than 1000 h in symmetrical cell at 1 mA cm−2 and 1 mAh cm−2, or capacity retention of 88.9% after 800 cycles for the full cell at 1C with 2.45 mAh cm−2 in carbonate ester-based electrolyte.
HASANZADEH2022132958¡A novel systematic multi-objective optimization to achieve high-efficiency and low-emission waste polymeric foam gasification using response surface methodology and TOPSIS method¡Waste polymeric foam= Gasification= Rigid polyurethane foam= Multi-objective optimization¡Gasification is one of the most important thermochemical processes to convert a solid fuel to energy carriers of a gaseous product called syngas. This process has been well addressed in the literature for biomass and several valuable researches have been performed on plastic waste gasification. However, it is the first effort for a systematic comprehensive investigation and multi-objective optimization of gasification process for waste polymeric foams using response surface methodology and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution) approach. Air and steam waste rigid polyurethane foam gasifications were modeled using coupled method of Gibbs minimization free energy and Lagrange method of undetermined multipliers, and then, validated. Effects of key features consisting gasification temperature and moisture content in both air and steam gasification types and equivalence ratio in air and steam to waste foam ratio in steam types were thoroughly studied on gas composition and energy and hydrogen efficiencies. Analysis of variance was employed for recognizing the most effective parameters on air and steam gasification performances. The results revealed that hydrogen and energy efficiencies of air gasification at multi-objective optimum conditions were 42.68 % and 89.58 %, respectively, and these values were 64.02 % and 96.52 % for steam gasification type. Air gasification of waste rigid polyurethane foam produced 3.13 g of CO2 emission at optimum state; however, its value was 10.02 g for steam gasification type. A multi-criteria decision analysis based on TOPSIS method was utilized for selecting the best gasification type in different scenarios and the findings indicated that air gasification had better performance compared to steam type due to its low emissions.
WANG2022133010¡Sensitive X-ray detection and imaging by a scintillating Lead(II)-based Metal-Organic framework¡X-ray imaging= X-ray detection= Scintillatior¡Scintillators that exhibit X-ray stimulated light response have attracted increasing attention for their wide application in medical diagnosis and treatment, security inspection, industrial flaw detection and other aspects. However, the broader application of traditional inorganic and organic scintillators has been limited by their high preparation cost or poor adaptability to changeable environments. Here, a scintillating 1D metal–organic framework (MOF) [Pb(adda)(DMF)]n 1 (H2adda = (2E,2′E)-3,3′-(anthracene-9,10-diyl) diacrylic acid, DMF = N,N-dimethylformamide) was prepared by a low-cost and short-cycle solvothermal process. Benefiting from the intrinsic synergistic effect of functional motifs and robust architecture, sensitive and steady X-ray response signals of 1 are demonstrated with an excellent linearity to the X-ray dose rates and stable light output under 9 h per day continuous irradiation during five days. In addition, the flexible MOF-based scintillator film is firstly applied in X-ray imaging application, which achieves a relatively high spatial resolution of 5.5 lp mm−1. This work provides an effective visualization tool for X-ray radiography and verifies the potential application of flexible MOF-based scintillator film for X-ray imaging.
LI2022133050¡Non-peripheral octamethyl-substituted cobalt phthalocyanine nanorods supported on N-doped reduced graphene oxide achieve efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO¡Electrocatalysis= CO reduction= Non-peripheral octamethyl substitution= Cobalt Phthalocyanine¡Developing electrocatalysts that exhibit highly-efficient CO2reduction is crucial for a healthier environment. This report demonstrates that the eight methyl groups on cobalt phthalocyanine significantly improved its catalytic CO2 reduction performance. Theoretical computations confirmed that the non-peripheral octamethyl-substituted cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (N-CoMe2Pc) catalyst showed enhanced CO2 adsorption and activation on the Co surface at low overpotentials relative to pristine cobalt(II) phthalocyanine (CoPc). The N-CoMe2Pc nanorods and nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (NRGO) nanocomposites were successfully prepared by a facile, non-covalent immobilization strategy and their electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity was explored in both H-type and flow cell configurations. It was thus verified that immobilizing N-CoMe2Pc nanorods onto NRGO surfaces can lead to enhanced electroactivity and selectivity in terms of reducing CO2 to CO. Among the various tested nanocomposites, N-CoMe2Pc/NRGO with a catalyst: NRGO ratio of 6:10 showed superior CO faradaic efficiency/selectivity (90.0 %) and a total current density reaching 9.7 mA cm−2 at –0.8 V vs. RHE in an H-type cell containing a neutral electrolyte. A CO faradaic efficiency of 90.4% and a current density of 14.8 mA cm−2 were achieved at the same overpotential using a flow cell. The selectivity of this system was further improved to 94.1%, with an accompanying CO current density of 56.4 mA cm−2 and an impressive turnover frequency of 6.2 s−1 at lower potential (–0.6 V vs. RHE) in alkaline solution. This work provides new insights relevant for developing low-cost, effective, phthalocyanine-based catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction.
HU2022133039¡Efficient solar-driven H2O2 synthesis in-situ and sustainable activation to purify water via cascade reaction on ZnIn2S4-based heterojunction¡Solar-driven HO synthesis= Onsite production= Sustainable activation= Cascade reaction¡Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a significant green oxidant for environment and new energy, especially for Fenton-like system. Onsite production and sustainable consumption of H2O2 are the two critical challenges. Here, a fantastic 2D/1D hierarchical layered ZnIn2S4/TiO2 heterojunction is reported as an efficient catalyst for in-situ H2O2 production via 2-electrons oxygen reduction (ORR) process and be rapidly activated to high concentration hydroxyl radical (•OH) for water purification under visible light irradiation. The high-quality catalyst enables superior H2O2 production rate of 1530.59 μmol h−1 g−1 with an external quantum efficiency of 10.39% illuminated at 400 nm, is much higher than that of reported photocatalysts. The bimetallic sulfide ZnIn2S4 can effectively promote the activation of H2O2 due to the unsaturation of sulfur atoms, so that the wastewater containing tetracycline (50 ppm) can be degraded by 90% only within 60 min by ZnIn2S4/TiO2 via this cascade reaction. This work provides a novel strategy and ZnIn2S4-based catalyst for photocatalytic Fenton-like reaction.
YU2022132914¡Novel nanofiltration membrane prepared by amphiphilic random copolymer nanoparticles packing for high-efficiency biomolecules separation¡Nanofiltration= Amphiphilic copolymer= Soap-free emulsion polymerization= Charge-based separation¡Nanofiltration (NF) as a promising candidate is widely used in charge-based separation of ampholytic biomolecules. Construction of strongly charged permeation channel of NF membrane is one of the key factors for this process. In this work, random amphiphilic copolymer (RACP) nanoparticles were first packed to prepare nanoscale permeation channel. The RACP emulsion was firstly prepared by soap-free emulsion polymerization between [2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl] trimethyl ammonium chloride (DMC) and methyl methacrylate (MMA), and then directly depositing onto porous substrate to form nanochannel selective layer of NF membrane. The optimal NF membrane shows a relatively large pore structure (i.e., cut-off pore size is 1.43 nm) and high pure water permeance (PWP) of 13.3 L·m−2·h−1·bar−1. Moreover, it shows a desirable rejection of basic amino acids and biopeptides (i.e., ∼95%) and allows neutral or acidic ones with similar molecule weight to permeate through. This work provides an innovative and facile method directly from RACP emulsion to construct NF membrane via nanoparticle packing, which greatly simplifies the preparation procedure for NF membrane. In addition, this novel NF membrane also demonstrates great potential in charge-based separation of biomolecules.
TRIPATHI2022103303¡MTCD: Cataract detection via near infrared eye images¡Iris= Cataract= Biometrics= Classification= Deep learning¡Globally, cataract is a common eye disease and one of the leading causes of blindness and vision impairment. The traditional process of detecting cataracts involves eye examination using a slit-lamp microscope or ophthalmoscope by an ophthalmologist, who checks for clouding of the normally clear lens of the eye. The lack of resources and unavailability of a sufficient number of experts pose a burden to the healthcare system throughout the world, and researchers are exploring the use of AI solutions for assisting the experts. Inspired by the progress in iris recognition, in this research, we present a novel algorithm for cataract detection using near-infrared eye images. The NIR cameras, which are popularly used in iris recognition, are of relatively low cost and easy to operate compared to ophthalmoscope setup for data capture. However, such NIR images have not been explored for cataract detection. We present deep learning-based eye segmentation and multitask network classification networks for cataract detection using NIR images as input. The proposed segmentation algorithm efficiently and effectively detects non-ideal eye boundaries and is cost-effective, and the classification network yields very high classification performance on the cataract dataset.
YU2022103314¡HSGAN: Reducing mode collapse in GANs by the latent code distance of homogeneous samples¡Generative adversarial networks= Mode collapse¡In this paper, we propose HSGAN, a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) variant that plays an adversarial game on the distance between two homogeneous samples (HS) in the latent space. HSGAN alleviates the notorious problem of mode collapse by maintaining a certain distance between the latent code of the generated data. Moreover, HSGAN is directly trained on the encoder and the generator, thereby gaining the ability to conduct inference without introducing any other model complexity. We prove theoretically that the objective function is designed to minimize the f-divergence between the distributions of the generated data and the real data. Extensive experiments on a series of synthetic and real image benchmark datasets demonstrate that HSGAN generates diverse images while keeping high quality, and it generally outperforms other GANs that target at the mode collapse problem.
AN2022103295¡Deep structural information fusion for 3D object detection on LiDAR–camera system¡3D object detection= LiDAR–camera system¡3D object detection on LiDAR–camera system is a challenging task, for 3D LiDAR point and 2D RGB image have different data representation. In this paper, We consider that the geometrical consistency in the local 3D and 2D regions is helpful for the regression task in 3D object detection, and propose 3D–2D consistent feature. It is based on hand-crafted 3D and 2D descriptors, generates primary structure feature, and has stable performance in outdoor scenes. Considering that material feature can be used to distinguish different objects, material coefficients ratio (MCR) is proposed to generate primary semantic feature, benefiting the classification task in 3D object detection. It is based on Lambertian model. To take advantage of both 3D–2D consistent feature and MCR, we propose deep 3D–2D structural information fusion (SIF) for 3D object detection. It provides attentional structural voxel feature, used as the input of LiDAR voxel based 3D object detectors. SIF is a light, effective, and explainable module. In the outdoor 3D object detection dataset, extensive experiments demonstrate that SIF improves the performance for both LiDAR voxel based single stage and multi-stage 3D detectors.
LI2022103301¡Simultaneous multi-person tracking and activity recognition based on cohesive cluster search¡Group activity= Collective activity recognition= Pairwise interaction¡We present a bootstrapping framework to simultaneously improve multi-person tracking and activity recognition at individual, interaction and social group activity levels. The inference consists of identifying trajectories of all pedestrian actors, individual activities, pairwise interactions, and collective activities, given the observed pedestrian detections. Our method uses a graphical model to represent and solve the joint tracking and recognition problems via three stages: (i) activity-aware tracking, (ii) joint interaction recognition and occlusion recovery, and (iii) collective activity recognition. This full-stack problem induces great complexity in learning the representations for the sub-problems at each stage, and the complexity increases as with more stages in the system. Our solution is to make use of symbolic cues for inference at higher stages, inspired by the observations of cohesive clusters at different stages. This also avoids learning more ambiguous representations in the higher stages. High-order correlations among the visible and occluded individuals, pairwise interactions, groups, and activities are then solved using the cohesive cluster search within a Bayesian framework. Experiments on several benchmarks show the advantages of our approach over the existing methods.
GONTHIER2022103299¡Multiple instance learning on deep features for weakly supervised object detection with extreme domain shifts¡Deep learning= Convolutional neural networks= Weakly supervised object detection= Non-photographic images= Art analysis¡Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) using only image-level annotations has attracted a growing attention over the past few years. Whereas such task is typically addressed with a domain-specific solution focused on natural images, we show that a simple multiple instance approach applied on pre-trained deep features yields excellent performances on non-photographic datasets, possibly including new classes. The approach does not include any fine-tuning or cross-domain learning and is therefore efficient and possibly applicable to arbitrary datasets and classes. We investigate several flavors of the proposed approach, some including multi-layers perceptron and polyhedral classifiers. Despite its simplicity, our method shows competitive results on a range of publicly available datasets, including paintings (People-Art, IconArt), watercolors, cliparts and comics and allows to quickly learn unseen visual categories.
LI2022116027¡One-shot neural architecture search for fault diagnosis using vibration signals¡Neural architecture search= Fault diagnosis= Vibration signals¡Machine learning method has been widely applied in industrial fault diagnosis, especially the deep learning method. In the field of industrial fault diagnosis, deep learning is mostly used to extract features of vibration signals to achieve end-to-end fault diagnosis systems. Due to the complexity and variety of actual industrial datasets, some deep learning models are designed to be complicated. However, designing neural network architectures requires rich professional knowledge, experience, and a large number of experiments, increasing the difficulty of developing deep learning models. Fortunately, Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a branch of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), is developing rapidly. Given a search space, NAS can search for networks that perform better than manually designed. In this paper, a one-shot NAS method for fault diagnosis is proposed. The one-shot model is a supernet that contains all candidate networks in a given search space. The supernet is trained to evaluate the actual performance of candidate networks by measuring the difference between its output probability and the true labels. According to the prediction of supernet, the networks with excellent performance can be searched, using some common search methods such as random search or evolutionary algorithm. Finally, the searched network is trained by reusing the weights of the supernet. To evaluate the proposed method, two search spaces are designed, ResNet and Inception search spaces, to search on PHM 2009 Data Challenge gearbox dataset. The state-of-the-art results are obtained, and accuracies of searched ResNet-A and Inception-A are 84.11% and 83.81%, which are 3.29% and 10.88% higher than Reinforcement Learning based NAS.
CHRISTENSEN2022116156¡Principles for small-unit sUAS tactical deployment from a combat-simulating agent-based model analysis¡Military decision-making processes= Unmanned system tactics= Agent-based modeling¡Recent increases in the operational and information gathering capabilities of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) have made their deployment with small units of infantry attractive. Determining the potential impacts of sUAS deployment on infantry combat effectiveness and effectively disseminating that information to decision-making warfighters is imperative. This work presents an analysis of data generated by a Monte-Carlo simulation of 137,000 unique simulations of a static-defense scenario wherein defending units deploy sUAS in an information, surveillance, and reconnaissance role to aid in detecting, tracking, and targeting attacking units with indirect fires. The relationships between the number of UAVs deployed, the patrol method for those UAVs, and 40 combat effectiveness metrics are explored using a correlation matrix and other graphical methods. A set of eight principles for effective sUAs deployment in the aforementioned scenario are distilled from the simulation data and presented for further testing and validation.
ZHANG2022116048¡Evaluation of a new dataset for visual detection of cervical precancerous lesions¡Cervical cancer detection= Dataset= Deep learning¡Automated visual evaluation (AVE) is an emerging method to detect and diagnose cervical precancerous lesions by imaging and analysis via a deep learning classifier. Challenges in AVE development come from not only the limited data available, but also a proper design of the learning protocol. The most analyzed dataset (PEG) is traced to a clinical trial at a single site, where all the images were captured in a well controlled environment. Recently, cervical images have been captured by a light-weight mobile solution where the screening images were collected from a wider user pool at many sites. This paper introduces a new data resource (EVA dataset), collected by providers using a mobile colposcope during their routine practice. Compared to PEG, EVA images contain higher levels of data variations and exhibits a different distribution over multiple image attributes including image sharpness, brightness and colorfulness. In order to evaluate the practical value of EVA dataset for cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) diagnosis, we further present an analysis of how a deep learning based framework can be used with both datasets by evaluating three key technical components: (1) region-of-interest (ROI) detection, (2) data augmentation and (3) pre-trained deep learning model selection. Our results indicate that ROI detection and shallow deep learning models usually help the detection on both datasets. While most data augmentations are effective on the EVA dataset, the improvement is less pronounced on PEG. Overall, using a deep-learning based framework looks promising for high-grade SIL diagnosis but there is still large room for improvements, especially on the EVA dataset. The noted differences indicate that the EVA dataset presents more practical challenges for high-grade SIL diagnosis and AVE classifier development.
KONOVALENKO2022116208¡Generating decision support for alarm processing in cold supply chains using a hybrid k-NN algorithm¡k-nearest neighbors= Fuzzy set= Recommendation= Decision Support= Pharmaceutical supply chain¡Real-time temperature monitoring is necessary in cold pharmaceutical supply chains (SCs), where exposures to extreme temperatures can lead to product quality deterioration. Temperature alarms (TAs) triggered by the current rule-based systems still require lengthy examinations before a suitable corrective measure (CM) can be chosen. However, provision of additional information relevant to TAs can expedite the examination process. In the related areas of recommender systems and false alarm/anomaly detection, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm has proven to be successful because of its interpretability and ease of use. However, in the context of TA processing, it may suffer from some inherent limitations (i.e., varying neighborhood radius, unreliable classifications in sparse and noisy regions, and blindness to natural class boundaries). To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid k-NN (Hk-NN) algorithm based on the principles of local similarity and neighborhood homogeneity. It incorporates a two-step voting procedure with an entropy-optimized k-NN radius, decision trees with k-constrained leaves, and nearest neighbor predictions. We investigate 16,525 comments by alarm personnel for TAs in a pharmaceutical SC and encode them in terms of deviation causes and CMs (target features). We use SC data on cargo location, SC phase, sensor role, and temperature characteristics as predictor features for TA similarity estimation. In eight experimental setups, Hk-NN consistently outperforms k-NN with an optimized k in terms of accuracy, balanced accuracy, macro-average precision, recall, and specificity. At the same time, Hk-NN refrains from predicting observations, for which k-NN’s accuracy is close to a random guess.
JACKSON2022116223¡Talk to The Ghost: The Storybox methodology for faster development of storytelling chatbots¡Chatbot= Intelligent interfaces= Storytelling= Response generation= Conversational agent¡This paper presents the Storybox Methodology which combines a novel framework for structuring knowledge and conversations around a story (D-PAF), with a live chatroom-based training approach that builds the conversation knowledge base via live chatroom interactions. Chatbots have achieved success as intelligent interfaces in education, health, sales and support, but their move towards mainstream adoption has been hindered by the large amount of development resources required, in terms of data collection, preparation, user testing and technical knowledge. The complexity of the development task often necessitates both a system author and a domain expert working effectively together, adding further complexity and risk. Overcoming these barriers could increase feasibility of chatbots in a range of expert contexts. In education, there are groups of learners who do not enjoy reading and writing. Storytelling chatbots might be able to introduce these groups to enjoyable new ways to read and write, having a beneficial impact on their education and future prospects. This paper proposes the Storybox Methodology for the rapid development of storytelling chatbots. Storybox is evaluated by creating, training and testing ‘The Ghost’, a chatbot enacting Hamlet's Ghost character from William Shakespeare's dramatic tragedy. The results showed that after a period of live chatbot training of only 25 training conversations, The Ghost was able to conduct convincing conversations with participants.
KARA2022116198¡The rise of ransomware: Forensic analysis for windows based ransomware attacks¡Cybersecurity= Digital forensic= Malware attacks= Ransomware detection= Onion ransomware¡While information technologies grow and propagate worldwide, malwares have modified and risen their efficiency towards information system. Recently, the attackers have started to use ransom software (ransomware) as an effective method of cyberattack because of their profitability. Ransomware infiltrate victim systems in various ways, usually encrypt files in the system, and demand a ransom to allow user access to the encrypted files again. Although security mechanisms such as firewalls, anti-virus programs, and automated analysis programs have been developed to combat this threat, these mechanisms have little success and fail to protect the valuable assets stored in local or cloud storage resources. In this study, an effective detection and analysis method against ransomware was proposed, and the proposed method was discussed in detail with a case study. As a result of the study, potential information about the attacker were found to be accessible through characteristic behavior analysis of the onion ransomware, which was analyzed in accordance with the proposed method. This paper also presents an insight to the ransomware threat and provides a basic review of the methods and techniques used in the detection and analysis of ransomware attacks.
AGARWAL2022116154¡Improvements in Multi-Document Abstractive Summarization using Multi Sentence Compression with Word Graph and Node Alignment¡Multi-document abstraction= Word Graph= Node alignment= Multi sentence compression¡The present work proposes a scheme for multi-document abstractive text summarization using node-aligned Word Graph based representation of clustered sentences. In the first step, the proposed scheme uses SBERT embedding for representing the sentences as fixed-size vectors. The sentences belonging to the same cluster are then represented using Word Graph, in which words of different sentences are aligned based on their semantic and syntactic similarities. The advantage of the above representation is that it utilizes alignment information of words between pairs of similar sentences to merge nodes in the Word Graph, and thereby facilitating the generation of sentences with multiple chunks of information. A sentence scoring function assisted by an intensification function is used to measure the grammaticality and informativeness of the generated sentences. Integer Linear Programming has been used to make the final selection of the scored sentences for generating the abstract. Experiments conducted for the task of sentence fusion and multi-document summarization demonstrate superior performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques available in the literature.
MEI2022116165¡Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph Transformer based drug repurposing¡Drug repurposing= Graph neural network= Graph transformer= Link prediction¡Drug repurposing refers to discovery of new medical instructions for existing chemical drugs, which has great pharmaceutical significance. Recently, large-scale biological datasets are increasingly available, and many graph neural network (GNN) based methods for drug repurposing have been developed. These methods often deem drug repurposing as a link prediction problem, which mines features of biological data to identify drug–disease associations (i.e., drug–disease links). Due to heterogeneity of data, we need to deeply explore heterogeneous information of biological network for drug repurposing. In this paper, we propose a Relation-aware Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (RHGT) model to capture heterogeneous information for drug repurposing. We first construct a drug–gene–disease interactive network-based on biological data, and then propose a three-level network embedding model, which learns network embeddings at fine-grained subtype-level, node-level and coarse-grained edge-level, respectively. The output of subtype-level is the input of node-level and edge-level, and the output of node-level is the input of edge level. We get edge embeddings at edge-level, which integrates edge type embeddings and node embeddings. We deem that in this way, characteristics of drug–gene–disease interactive network can be captured more comprehensively. Finally, we identify drug–disease associations (i.e., drug–disease links) based on the relationship between drug–gene edge embeddings and gene–disease edge embeddings. Experimental results show that our model performs better than other state-of-the-art graph neural network methods, which validates effectiveness of the proposed model.
JOKIC2022116203¡Semantic segmentation based stereo visual servoing of nonholonomic mobile robot in intelligent manufacturing environment¡Visual servoing= Semantic segmentation= Nonholonomic mobile robot= Image registration= Stereo camera system¡In the interest of developing an intelligent manufacturing environment with an agile, efficient, and optimally utilized transportation system, mobile robots need to achieve a certain level of autonomy as they play an important role in carrying out transportation tasks. Bearing this in mind, in the paper we propose a novel stereo visual servoing method for nonholonomic mobile robot control based on semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation provides a rich body of information required for an adequate decision-making process in a clustered, dynamic, and ever-changing manufacturing environment. The innovative idea behind the new visual servoing system is to utilize semantic information of the scene for visual servoing, as well as for other mobile robot tasks, such as obstacle avoidance, scene understanding, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Semantic segmentation is carried out by exploiting fully convolutional neural networks. The new visual servoing algorithm utilizes an intensity-based image registration procedure, which results in the image transformation matrix. The transformation matrix encompasses the relations of images taken at the current and desired pose, and that information is directly used for visual servoing. The developed algorithm is deployed on our own developed wheeled differential drive mobile robot RAICO (Robot with Artificial Intelligence based COgnition). The experimental evaluation is carried out in the 3D simulation environment and in the laboratory model of the real manufacturing environment. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed approach is improved when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches while being robust to the partial occlusions of the scene and illumination changes.
RADMAN2022115980¡Deep residual network for face sketch synthesis¡Face sketch synthesis= Deep learning= Residual learning¡Face sketch synthesis plays a crucial role in face recognition for law enforcement applications. However, the current face sketch synthesis approaches generate sketches from photos based on a model trained by a certain database that is usually collected from individuals of the same ethnicity, and therefore such sketches merely inherit distinct facial distributions (shape and texture) of this database. This also makes such models inapplicable for real-world applications which mainly include multiple photo variations such as pose, lighting, skin color, and ethnic origin. In this paper, a unified face sketch synthesis model considering ethnicity issue as well as photo variations is proposed. A new deep learning scheme is designed to handle the generic visual representation and global structure of the face. Towards the final objective, the recent success of deep residual blocks is exploited and incorporated into a plain feedforward network, termed as DResNet, to learn a regression model for face sketch synthesis. A heterogeneous database containing photos with lighting, ethnicity, hair and skin variations is utilized for training the DResNet model. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations showed the superiority of the proposed DResNet method on state-of-the-art face sketch synthesis methods. Experimental results also demonstrated that the proposed DResNet method can be generalized to face sketch synthesis for real-world applications.
TANEJA2022116106¡An optimized scheme for energy efficient wireless communication via intelligent reflecting surfaces¡Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs)= Energy efficiency (EE)= Green communication¡Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are considered as a promising candidate enabling technology for future green wireless communication. Such intelligent surfaces have real-time reconfigurable properties that beamform the signal to a desired destination. In this paper, our objective is to study the performance optimization in an IRS-assisted wireless network. An array of reflecting elements is individually configured in IRS system set up, which is installed between the source and the destination to assist the communication between both without any obstacle. IRS-assisted network achieves significant performance gain as compared to wireless networks without IRS. However, there are severe practical challenges with IRSs including hardware impairments, size of IRS, and distribution of reflecting elements in the IRS. To tackle these issues, we analyzed the performance of the network for maximum achievable rates, minimum transmit power, and maximum energy efficiency (EE). The selection of optimal number of reflecting elements in the IRS enables huge savings in energy to achieve target rate with minimal power. We show that by incorporating optimal number of reflecting elements in IRSs, high EE can be achieved, which outperforms the direct transmission method. Moreover, we show the impact of increasing the number of reflecting elements on the trade-off between EE and achievable rates.
S2022116168¡Bag-of-Event-Models based embeddings for detecting anomalies in surveillance videos¡Surveillance videos= Anomaly detection= Bag-of-Event-Models= Motion Boundary Histograms= Hidden Markov Model¡Automated monitoring of unconstrained videos is becoming mandatory due to its widespread applications over public and private domains. Especially, research over detecting anomalous human behaviors in surveillance videos has created much attention. Understanding patterns in surveillance videos are always challenging due to the rapid movement of the crowd, occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. The intra-class variations existing among normal and abnormal events lead to poor performance of anomaly detection system. These issues can be addressed by learning discriminative embeddings for video segments of surveillance videos. We propose an efficient Bag-of-Event-Models (BoEM) based embedding to represent video segments of normal and abnormal behaviors. Proposed BoEM can also be formed using training data of normal events only and the embeddings can be given as input to one-class classifier such as OC-SVM in an outlier detection fashion. The proposed embeddings handle intra-class variations and provide improved discrimination with much reduced dimension. Results over benchmark datasets namely Live Videos (LV), UCF-Crime and Crowd Violence demonstrate that the proposed BoEM based event embeddings in conjunction with SVM Classifier give significantly better performance than the other state-of-the-art methods. In addition, studies prove that the proposed embeddings are appropriate even for imbalanced sequential data such as video segments.
CANIZARES2022116149¡SINPA: SupportINg the automation of construction PlAnning¡Constraint programming= Construction sites planning¡We present SINPA: an integrated framework to support construction site planners. The most basic functionality of our tool provides a user-friendly framework to represent causality relations (precedence and parallelism) between the different tasks conforming a project. SINPA strongly relies on a constraint solver and makes an intensive use of constraints. SINPA automatically studies optimisations of the original planning, recomputes the solutions and provides recommendations in an intuitive way so that the planners can modify their original plan. It is important to emphasise that the users of SINPA do not need to work with or understand Constraint Programming.
IMAMOVIC2022116185¡Comprehensive fuzzy logic coefficient of performance of absorption cooling system¡Absorption cooling system= Coefficient of performance= Fuzzy logic= Temperature= Mass flow rate¡The Absorption Cooling System (ACS) coefficient of performance (COP) is a key parameter that describes the degree of efficiency of this type of cooling system. In all previous analyses, this coefficient was determined in a deterministic way, which in the case of the operation of a thermodynamic system, such as ACS, does not ensure its optimal operation. Therefore, in this paper, Comprehensive Fuzzy Logic COP (CFLCOP) is presented, which enables a more flexible operation of ACS and more precise action on those components of ACS that do not contribute to its optimal operation. The CFLCOP includes two fuzzy logic-based COPs: one based on energy efficiency (ENFLCOP) and the other on exergy efficiency (EXFLCOP). The analysis of the use of CFLCOP shows a higher number of hours of ACS operation in the optimal mode, compared to the deterministic COP (DCOP) and a higher degree of continuity of ACS operation at the desired cooling temperature.
DAOUI2022116193¡Robust image encryption and zero-watermarking scheme using SCA and modified logistic map¡Image encryption= Image zero-watermarking= Geometric attacks= Image copyright protection= Logistic map¡In this work, we first present a modified version of the traditional logistic chaotic map. The proposed version contains an additional parameter that is used to increase the security level of the proposed digital image copyright protection scheme. The latter merges two methods of image copyright protection, namely the image zero-watermarking and image encryption, which provides a high level of security when communicating images via the Internet. Next, we discuss the influence of geometric attacks on the efficiency of the proposed scheme, and then we introduce an efficient solution that can resist such attacks. The proposed solution involves the use of Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA) with an appropriate algorithm suitable for the correction of geometric attacks (image translation, orientation and its combination) applied to the encrypted image. On the one hand, the simulation results show that the proposed scheme provides a high level of security and can resist various attacks (differential, common image processing, geometric, etc.). On the other hand, the conducted comparison in terms of robustness against geometric attacks clearly demonstrates the superiority of our scheme over recent image encryption ones.
ZHU2022116115¡Static or dynamic? Characterize and forecast the evolution of urban crime distribution¡Urban crime= Spatiotemporal framework= Crime distribution¡Despite the considerable deployed resources, current policing efforts are failing to stop crimes before they start, and therefore, also failing to adequately protect lives and property. To promote the intelligent transformation from reactive to proactive policing, this study proposed a hierarchical crime prediction framework. First, the temporal dependency in the frequency domain was decomposed and a network constructed to capture the spatial relationships within the sub-frequencies. Human mobility in a city was then utilized to characterize the dynamic relationships within the network. Using the proposed framework, this study examined the crime distribution evolution in Chicago to holistically predict the short-term crimes in the different communities. The framework was found to have high predictive accuracy and significant potential in promoting proactive policing. It was concluded that: (1) as the crime distribution evolution comes from the spatial relationship changes, these dynamic relationships are critical in explaining and characterizing the evolution; and (2) the social interactions constructed using the human activity data can characterize the dynamic crime distribution relationships.
XU2022116197¡Zero-shot learning for compound fault diagnosis of bearings¡Fault diagnosis= Zero-shot Learning= Compound fault diagnosis¡Due to the concurrency and coupling of various types of faults, and the number of possible fault modes grows exponentially, thereby compound fault diagnosis is a difficult problem in bearing fault diagnosis. The existing deep learning models can extract fault features when there are a large number of labeled compound fault samples. In industrial scenarios, collecting and labeling sufficient compound fault samples are unpractical. Using the model trained on single fault samples to identify unknown compound faults is challenging and innovative. To address this problem, we propose a Zero-shot Learning Compound Fault Diagnosis Model of bearings (ZLCFDM). We design an encoding method to express the semantics of single faults and compound faults according to the fault characteristics. A convolutional neural network is developed to extract the time–frequency features of the compound fault signal. Then we embed the semantic feature of the fault into the visual space of the fault data. The Euclidean distance is used to measure the distance between the signal features and the semantic features of the compound faults to identify the categories of unknown compound faults. To validate the proposed method, we conduct experiments on a self-built testbed. The results demonstrate that the accuracy of identifying compound fault reached 77.73% when the model was trained without any compound fault samples.
DESOUZA2022116180¡Dynamic Programming algorithms and their applications in machine scheduling: A review¡Scheduling= Dynamic Programming= Survey= Exact methods¡This paper aims at presenting a compilation of state-of art references in which dynamic programming (DP) and its variants have been applied as a solution methods for the deterministic machine scheduling problems. Overall, 183 articles have been gathered and their segmentation was carried out according to the machine environment that characterized the problems addressed by the authors and ultimately, the objective functions that were intended to be optimized. Additionally, we standardized the information provided by each article by presenting the problems discussed by the authors, comparisons between previous works on the same problem (if it was deemed necessary), the algorithms’ complexities and an extension of methods to computational experiments (in case they have been stated). Finally, at the end of each section we furnish a discussion on the main contributions of DP to the each environment and also suggest some further applications of DP to machine scheduling problems, thus showing the potential resources that can be derived from the method in terms of theoretical/practical approaches.
KURANGA2022116163¡A comparative study of nonlinear regression and autoregressive techniques in hybrid with particle swarm optimization for time-series forecasting¡Time-series forecasting= Least-squares= Nonlinear autoregressive= Concept shifts= Passive learning¡Usually, real-world time-series forecasting problems are dynamic. If such time-series are characterized by mere concept shifts, a passive approach to learning become ideal to continuously adapt the model parameters whenever new data patterns arrive to cope with uncertainty in the presence of change. This work hybridizes a quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization designed for dynamic environments, to cope with concept shifts, with either a least-squares approximation technique or nonlinear autoregressive model to forecast time-series. Also, this work evaluates experimentally and performs a comparative study on the performance of the proposed models. The obtained results show that the nonlinear autoregressive-based model outperformed the least-squares approximation-based model and the separate models that were implemented in the hybridization and also, several state-of-the-art models for the given datasets.
LEE2022116206¡Concept drift modeling for robust autonomous vehicle control systems in time-varying traffic environments¡Concept drift learning= Time-varying environments= Autonomous vehicle systems= Traffic control¡Autonomous vehicle systems (AVSs) are widely used to transfer wafers in semiconductor manufacturing. However, in such systems, robust traffic control is a significant challenge because all vehicles must be monitored and controlled in real time to cope with traffic congestion. Several predictive approaches have been proposed to prevent traffic congestion in stationary traffic environments. However, in real-life traffic situations, concept drifts exist, which are characterized by time-varying traffic conditions that hinder the accurate prediction of congestion. In this study, we propose a concept drift modeling framework for a robust vehicle control system. The proposed method combines a drift-adaptation learning technique with a drift detector to achieve adaptive traffic prediction in time-varying AVSs. We compare the effectiveness of the prediction and efficiency of model updates with representative methods. High-fidelity simulations based on actual data confirm that the proposed method outperforms alternative methods by detecting change patterns and updating prediction models whenever significant concept drifts occur in traffic patterns.
SHEIKHHOSSEINI2022116164¡Connectivity and coverage constrained wireless sensor nodes deployment using steepest descent and genetic algorithms¡Connectivity= Coverage= Genetic algorithm= Steepest descent algorithm with Armijo and Wolf rules¡Connectivity and different coverage types including target, area, and barrier coverages are among the most critical challenges of wireless sensor networks (WSN). This paper investigates node deployment for the challenges of target coverage, area coverage, and connectivity over randomly distributed homogeneous and heterogeneous WSNs, and suggests a new method in both centralized and distributed modes which (i) covers all targets by the required number of sensors, (ii) provides maximum area coverage and connectivity over the network, and (iii) manages sensors' movement from the initial locations to the final ones. Specifically, in the case of target coverage, a new analytical deployment method using the steepest descend (SD) algorithm with Armijo and Wolf rules is proposed instead of evolutionary methods. The results demonstrate this method outperforms over Genetic algorithm (GA) in managing sensors' movement towards targets, guaranteeing 100% coverage in targets, and providing a significant reduction- more than 40% in the worst condition-in algorithm complexity. However, when area coverage and connectivity are also considered, a new hybrid deployment method, which first uses GA to extract the optimal sensors' coordinates via analyzing these challenges simultaneously and then employs SD algorithm to move sensors towards these locations, is suggested. Numerical results confirm the complexity of this two-step method is approximately identical to the GA method of existing research; however, it provides sensors' trajectory and more accuracy for network coverage and connectivity.
ABDELBASSET2022116145¡HWOA: A hybrid whale optimization algorithm with a novel local minima avoidance method for multi-level thresholding color image segmentation¡Color image segmentation= Whale optimization algorithm= Otsu method= Local minima elimination method¡Traditional methods to address color image segmentation work efficiently for bi-level thresholding. However, for multi-level thresholding, traditional methods suffer from time complexity that increases exponentially with the increasing number of threshold levels. To overcome this problem, in this paper, a new approach is proposed to tackle multi-threshold color image segmentation by employing the Otsu method as an objective function. This approach is based on a hybrid of the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) with a novel method called the local minima avoidance method (LMAM), abbreviated as HWOA. LMAM avoids local minima by updating the whale either within the search space of the problem or between two whales selected randomly from the population-based on a certain probability. HWOA is validated on ten color images taken from the Berkeley University Dataset by measuring the objective values, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), features similarity index (FSIM), and CPU time, and compared with a number of the well-known robust meta-heuristic algorithms: the sine–cosine algorithm (SCA), WOA, modified salp swarm algorithm (MSSA), improved marine predators algorithm (IMPA), modified Cuckoo Search (CS) using McCulloch’s algorithm (CSMC), and equilibrium optimizer (EO). The experimental results show that HWOA is superior to all the other algorithms in terms of PSNR, FSIM, and objective values, and is competitive in terms of SSIM.
ZHANG2022116187¡Tri-level attribute reduction in rough set theory¡Attribute reduction= Three-way decision= Tri-level analysis= Object-specific attribute reducts= Tri-level attribute reducts¡Attribute reduction serves as a pivotal topic of rough set theory for data analysis. The ideas of tri-level thinking from three-way decision can shed new light on three-level attribute reduction. Existing classification-specific and class-specific attribute reducts consider only macro-top and meso-middle levels. This paper introduces a micro-bottom level of object-specific reducts. The existing two types of reducts apply to the global classification with all objects and a local class with partial objects, respectively. The new type applies to an individual object. These three types of reducts constitute tri-level attribute reducts. Their development and hierarchy are worthy of systematical explorations. Firstly, object-specific reducts are defined by object consistency from dependency, and they improve both classification-specific and class-specific reducts. Secondly, tri-level reducts are unified by tri-level consistency. Hierarchical relationships between object-specific reducts and class-specific, classification-specific reducts are analyzed, and relevant connections of three-way classifications of attributes are given. Finally, tri-level reducts are systematically analyzed, and two approaches, i.e., the direct calculation and hierarchical transition, are suggested for constructing a specific reduct. We build a framework of tri-level thinking and analysis of attribute reduction to enrich three-way granular computing. Tri-level reducts lead to the sequential development and hierarchical deepening of attribute reduction, and their results profit intelligence processing and system reasoning.
COLAK2022116192¡On the fly image denoising using patch ordering¡Image denoising= Patch ordering¡We introduce an image denoising algorithm which utilizes a novel online dictionary learning procedure together with patch ordering. The developed algorithm employs both the non-local image processing power of patch ordering and the sequential patch-based update of online dictionary learning. The patch ordering process exploits the similarities between patches of a given image which are extracted from different locations. Joint processing of the ordered set of image patches facilitates the non-local image processing ability of the algorithm. The algorithm starts with the extraction of a maximally overlapped set of patches from the given noisy image. Then, the extracted patches are reordered by using a distance measure, and the 3D ordered patch cube is formed. The ordered patch cube is used sequentially to update an overcomplete dictionary. In each iteration, firstly the present patch is denoised using sparse coding over the current overcomplete dictionary. Secondly, the overcomplete dictionary is updated using the current image patch, and the dictionary is passed to the next iteration. We call this process as “on the fly denoising”, because each patch is individually denoised using an instantaneously updated overcomplete dictionary. Patch ordering together with online dictionary learning ensures that the dictionary is adapted to different neighborhoods of patches in the patch cube. This adaptation of the dictionary to specialized local patch structures in the patch cube promises improved denoising performance when compared to dictionary learning algorithms devoid of such adaptation. Simulation results indicate that the introduced online method presents improved denoising performance in comparison to both online and batch dictionary learning algorithms from the literature while maintaining similar computational complexity.
WANG2022116127¡A novel predictive method based on key points for dynamic multi-objective optimization¡Dynamic multi-objective optimization= TOPSIS= Clustering strategy¡Dynamic multi-objective problem is very difficult to be solved because of the variability of the objective function with time. To overcome the difficult caused by such variability, a predictive method utilizing some key points (including polar points and centroid points) is designed, which contains four critical steps. First, the whole population is automatically divided into multiple clusters, which will be used to preserve a good diversity in the process of population evolution. Second, the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), a well-regarded multi-attribute decision making strategy, is exploited to improve its convergence speed further. Third, the polar point and centroid point in each cluster are utilized to obtain the initial population by using sequence predictive method when environmental changes are detected. Fourth, to accelerate the convergence speed, the quantitative value for each individual determined in the prediction process is also used in mating selection and environmental selection. The numerical results imply that the new method can deal with the change of environment effectively and track the Pareto optimal front (POF) quickly. Meanwhile, the comparison results with several selected state-of-the-art methods also show that the overall performance of the proposed method is the best on most benchmark problems.
NASIRI2022116184¡Robust control of congestion in computer networks: An adaptive fractional-order approach¡Congestion control= Fractional-order calculus= TCP/AQM network= Adaptive control¡In this study, the congestion problem of computer networks is solved by introducing an adaptive fractional-order controller. The controller is designed to enhance the efficiency of nonlinear transmission control protocol/active queue management (TCP/AQM) in these networks. External disturbances can perturb the data transmission. Moreover, factors such as undetermined link capacity can affect the congestion control problem. Hence, the proposed controller should guarantee robustness against disturbances and uncertainties. Besides, small elapsed time to reach the desired queue length as well as convergence of tracking error to zero are essential in queue management. These objectives are fulfilled by designing a fractional-order controller. High tracking capability and robustness make the controller an effective method for TCP/AQM networks. Furthermore, asymptotic stability of the network is precisely proven based on the fractional-order Lyapunov lemma. A variety of simulations are performed to examine capability of the proposed method confronting disturbances and uncertainties while providing a fast and stable response with zero tracking error. The results are also compared with the results of two recently developed control approaches for congestion problem, using performance indices, which confirm the efficiency and superiority of the introduced controller.
BHOWAL2022116167¡Fuzzy ensemble of deep learning models using choquet fuzzy integral, coalition game and information theory for breast cancer histology classification¡Breast cancer (BACH dataset)= Computer vision= Deep learning= Fuzzy ensemble= Choquet integral= Coalition game¡Millions of women, worldwide, suffer from breast cancer and a large number of them succumb to death. In recent years, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are being developed for the detection of Breast Cancer. A number of fusion techniques have been proposed in this domain, but none of them take into consideration the decisions taken by a subset of classifiers during fusion. Our method, which uses Choquet Integral, considers subsets of classifiers and is thus stronger than the existing methods and beat all of these existing fusion methods in terms of accuracy. This however poses a significant challenge in terms of complexity, since the calculation of the fuzzy measures is a complicated and complex task, which we have dealt with using a novel heuristic method by employing Coalition Game, Information Theory, and by defining a novel mathematical function. In the present work, we have fused VGG16, VGG19, Xception, Inception V3, and InceptionResnet V2 for the classification of breast cancer histology images using a Choquet integral, Coalition game theory, and Information theory. The dataset used for evaluating the proposed model is the ICIAR 2018 Grand Challenge on Breast Cancer Histology (popularly known as BACH) images, which consist of 2-class and 4-class problems. To the best of our knowledge, our experimental results outperform almost all the state-of-the-art methods. For the two-class problem, the best test accuracy among the five deep learning models was achieved by Xception and it was 95% while the Fusion method has a test accuracy of 96%. For the four-class problem, Xception and InceptionResnet V2 have achieved the best test accuracy and both have a test accuracy of 91% while the Fusion method has a test accuracy of 95%. Again, in the case of the two-class problem the best precision and recall by the deep learning models are 0.95 and 0.95 respectively, while the precision and recall for after fusion are 0.96 and 0.96 respectively which is an increase of .01. In the case of the four-class problem, the best precision and recall by the deep learning models are 0.91 and 0.91 respectively, while the precision and recall after fusion are 0.95 and 0.95 respectively which is a very significant increase of .04.

QIAN2022116202¡Financial distress prediction using a corrected feature selection measure and gradient boosted decision tree¡Financial distress prediction= Gradient boosted decision tree= Feature importance= Permutation importance¡Corporate financial distress prediction research has been ongoing for more than half a century, during which many models have emerged, among which ensemble learning algorithms are the most accurate. Most of the state-of-the-art methods of recent years are based on gradient boosted decision trees. However, most of them do not consider using feature importance for feature selection, and a few of them use the feature importance method with bias, which may not reflect the true importance of features. To solve this problem, a heuristic algorithm based on permutation importance (PIMP) is proposed to modify the biased feature importance measure in this paper. This method ranks and filters the features used by machine learning models, which not only improves accuracy but also makes the results more interpretable. Based on financial data from 4,167 listed companies in China between 2001 and 2019, the experiment shows that compared with using the random forest (RF) wrapper method alone, the bias in feature importance is indeed corrected by combining the PIMP method. After the redundant features are removed, the performance of most machine learning models is improved. The PIMP method is a promising addition to the existing financial distress prediction methods. Moreover, compared with traditional statistical learning models and other machine learning models, the proposed PIMP-XGBoost offers higher prediction accuracy and clearer interpretation, making it suitable for commercial use.
YANG2022116209¡Semantic and explainable research-related recommendation system based on semi-supervised methodology using BERT and LDA models¡Recommendation system= Semi-supervised learning= BERT¡With the launch of academic search engines such as Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic, and Scopus, researchers are using them to access scholarly materials on a large scale without making any payment. In this optimal research environment, academic libraries or community databases have naturally experienced a rapid increase in volume; however, the excessive quantitative growth of information, or information overload, acts as a double-edged sword that prevents researchers from finding relevant prior studies or researchers with similar interests. Existing keyword and rule-based search systems carry the risk of recommending research literature with a high citation frequency rather than recommending contextually similar documents. Therefore, this study proposes a semi-supervised semantic-based research literature and researcher recommendation system using LDA and BERT. Since a semi-supervised method is used, research literature can be embedded based on contextual and classification information, and the global topic information of the research literature can also be captured. In addition, a research literature information extractor system has been implemented, which comprises classification network of our model and an explainable keywords extractor system implemented using BERT’s self-attention structure. Based on the experimental results, it can be confirmed that the proposed study model shows better performance than other baselines. This model can help users to find information and contextual matching data quickly and accurately from the database. In addition, when implementing an academic library and community database, such a powerful research-related recommendation system and research literature information extractor are expected to have an enormous effect.
FIDAN2022116243¡A comparative study for determining Covid-19 risk levels by unsupervised machine learning methods¡Covid-19= Risk levels= Restrictions= Unsupervised machine learning= Clustering¡The restrictions have been preferred by governments to reduce the spread of Covid-19 and to protect people's health according to regional risk levels. The risk levels of locations are determined due to threshold values ​​based on the number of cases per 100,000 people without environmental variables. The purpose of our study is to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to determine the cities with similar risk levels by using the number of cases and environmental parameters. Hierarchical, partitional, soft, and gray relational clustering algorithms were applied to different datasets created with weekly the number of cases, population densities, average ages, and air pollution levels. Comparisons of the clustering algorithms were performed by using internal validation indexes, and the most successful method was identified. In the study, it was revealed that the most successful method in clustering based on the number of cases is Gray Relational Clustering. The results show that using the environmental variables for restrictions requires more clusters than 4 for healthier decisions and Gray Relational Clustering gives stable results, unlike other algorithms.
HU2022116031¡MBRep: Motif-based representation learning in heterogeneous networks¡Motif= Heterogeneous network= Representation learning¡In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in applying machine learning to graphs and networks that already exist in the world around us. The approach has been successfully used for domains as diverse as traffic management, e-commerce recommendation and public opinion monitoring. A critical aspect of representation learning for applied machine learning is feature engineering. Deep learning-based research in representation learning has developed methods for automatically learning a large number of potentially correlated features from original networks. However, most of these methods cannot be applied to heterogeneous networks, which are true expressions of the real-world. This is because they do not adequately capture the structure and semantics of different types of nodes in heterogeneous networks and the links between them. They also struggle to represent higher-order heterogeneous patterns of connection. This paper proposes a generalized motif-based higher-order representation learning method, MBRep, that learns triangle motif embedding in a network, on the basis of which it can obtain the embedding and representation of nodes in a heterogeneous network. Statistically, significant motif structures are extracted from the original heterogeneous network and combined with the heterogeneity of the nodes. A weight-biased random walk is then applied to the motif level higher-order network, using a SkipGram model to embed the motifs. After this, the embedding of the original network nodes is calculated using weighted averages and feature alignment. This can then be used for link prediction. We confirmed the effectiveness of MBRep by comparing its AUC and MRR performance with other state-of-the-art methods on three real-world datasets. Its adaptability was also validated by conducting a cold-start test.
LIU2022116178¡Gaussian-IoU loss: Better learning for bounding box regression on PCB component detection¡Object detection= PCB-components= Industrial inspection= Box regression¡Object detection with high accuracy is becoming increasingly important for industrial processes, such as producing printed circuit boards (PCBs). A false or missed detection during production can lead to serious quality issues. Therefore, an efficient detector that can maintain high quality is required for industrial applications. This paper proposes a method for improving detection accuracy while supporting real-time operations using the baseline YOLOv4. A new loss function for box regression called Gaussian intersection of union (GsIoU) is explored, which merges the predicted boxes under different anchors at the same position using a Gaussian function to calculate the box regression loss, improving the accuracy of the final box regression. The proposed PCB Component (PCBC) dataset is a benchmark comprising 18,948 images, 24 categories (containing the same component in different directions), and 508,313 components. Taking YOLOv4 as the experimental baseline on the PCBC dataset, the mean average precision (mAP) using the GsIoU has reached 86.9%, which is improved by 3.3% and 2.2% compared to using the CIoU and GIoU loss functions, respectively. The experiments were conducted on the COCO dataset to verify the generalization of the GsIoU. The detection accuracy of the GsIoU exceeds that GIoU and CIoU by 0.6% on AP50 and 0.6% on AP50:95, achieving 65.6% and 46.0% on the COCO test-val2017, respectively. The detection efficiency of the proposed method is the same as that of the baseline in the testing process and is slightly reduced in the training process owing to the synchronous calculation of the IoU, variance, and Gaussian operations on the network output. The experiments indicate that GsIoU is effective and efficient.
NAGAR2022116141¡Adaptive optimal multi-features learning based representation for face hallucination¡Face hallucination= Multiple-image-features= GWO= Optimization= Gaussian noise¡Face hallucination (FH) is a classical problem to reconstruct a high-resolution (HR) face image for an observed low-resolution (LR) one. The existing methods represent LR facial images though the spatial pixel domain or by combining confined image features with this spatial pixel information. However, the uncertainty in stipulating the optimal proportion for such multiple image features may lead to unexpected results as the optimal proportion for each LR input face image may vary for obtaining the desired HR result. Additionally, they suffer from degraded performance when the observed LR images are contaminated with higher noise. For addressing such problems, this paper proposes an adaptive optimal multi-features proportion learning (OMFPL) scheme, which adopts the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) approach for determining the optimum proportion of each feature to represent a particular LR face image. Moreover, an appropriate threshold is applied on different feature samples in the training data for representing the LR patches with their nearest examples. The optimal proportion of these relevant features helps to reconstruct the high-quality HR faces for both noise-free and noisy LR faces. The performance of OMFPL is validated on widely used public databases, real-world images, and surveillance faces, where it achieves the superior results concerning the several competitive state-of-the-art FH methods.
ZHOU2022116194¡Cross-lingual embeddings with auxiliary topic models¡Cross-lingual embeddings= Topical models= Word embedding models= Projection-based methods¡Projection-based methods for generating high-quality Cross-Lingual Embeddings (CLEs) have shown state-of-the-art performance in many multilingual applications. Supervised methods that rely on character-level information or unsupervised methods that need only monolingual information are both popular and have their pros and cons. However, there are still problems in terms of the quality of monolingual word embedding spaces and the generation of the seed dictionaries. In this work, we aim to generate effective CLEs with auxiliary Topic Models. We utilize both monolingual and bilingual topic models in the procedure of generating monolingual embedding spaces and seed dictionaries for projection. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model through the means of bilingual lexicon extraction, cross-lingual semantic word similarity and cross-lingual document classification tasks. We show that our proposed model outperforms existing supervised and unsupervised CLE models built on basic monolingual embedding spaces and seed dictionaries. It also exceeds CLE models generated from representative monolingual topical word embeddings.
LIU2022116216¡Obstacle avoidance for orchard vehicle trinocular vision system based on coupling of geometric constraint and virtual force field method¡Trinocular vision= Orchard vehicle= Row detection= Obstacle detection¡Nowadays the use of visual navigation in orchard is rapidly growing, while current research mainly focuses on orchard row detection or obstacle detection separately. The economic, fast and reliable navigation vision system that completing orchard row following and obstacle avoidance simultaneously and the obstacle avoidance algorithm for vision system without complex multiple navigation systems combining are needed further research. In this paper, a trinocular vision system for orchard vehicle is set up and the obstacle avoidance algorithm based on coupling of geometric constraint and virtual force field is designed for its vision system. First of all, based on analyzing the different vision system characteristics and the detection demand of orchard obstacle avoidance the trinocular vision system for orchard vehicle is set up based on a wide-angle camera and binocular stereo vision system. Then, the image processing algorithm of orchard row and obstacle detection is designed. For orchard row detection, the trunk regions enhancement algorithm is designed based on grayscale morphology filtering the trunk regions prediction algorithm is designed based on optical flow method to improve the trunk regions detection speed and accuracy. For obstacle detection, the background equalization algorithm based on H-channel image characteristics and the interference weaken algorithm with G-channel image characteristics are designed. Based on the row and obstacle detection results the algorithm for obstacle avoidance in orchard based on coupling of geometric constraint and virtual force field is designed. In the obstacle avoidance process, the virtual force field method is used as the mainly control of the vehicle obstacle avoidance process, and the geometric constraint between visual model of trinocular vision system and obstacle position is coupling with it to fulfill the avoidance demand of the obstacle with special shape and other condition that influence the virtual force field calculation. The experimental results show that the trinocular vision system for orchard vehicle built in this paper has strong adaptability to the actual environment which is accurate and stable for orchard row detection and obstacle detection simultaneously. The average deviation is 4.76 cm and 7.05 cm at 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s respectively, the average deviation of obstacle distance detection in the Z-axis direction is 3.18 cm, and in the X-axis direction is 0.45 cm. And the obstacle avoidance algorithm designed in this paper is effective in the orchard which can meet the actual production requirements. The research results will lay a foundation for the development of intelligent equipment and unmanned management in orchard.
HOSSEINI2022116151¡A hybrid greedy randomized heuristic for designing uncertain transport network layout¡Operations research= Heuristics= Uncertain programming= Network design¡The foundations of efficient management are laid on transport networks in various scientific and industrial fields. Nonetheless, establishing an optimum transport network design (TND) is complicated due to uncertainty in the operating environment. As a result, an uncertain network may be a more realistic representation of an actual transport network. The present study deals with an uncertain TND problem in which uncertain programming and the greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) are used to develop an original optimization framework and propose a solution technique for obtaining cost-efficient designs. To this end, we originally develop the concept of α-shortest cycle (α-SC) employing the pessimistic value criterion, given a user-defined predesignated confidence level α. Employing this concept and the operational law of uncertain programming, a new auxiliary chance-constrained programming model is established for the uncertain TND problem, and we prove the existence of an equivalence relation between TNDs in an uncertain network and those in an auxiliary deterministic network. Specifically, we articulate how to obtain the uncertainty distribution of the overall optimal uncertain network’s design cost. After all, the effectiveness and practical performance of the heuristic and optimization model is illustrated by adopting samples with different topology from a case study to show how our approach work in realistic networks and to highlight some of the heuristic’s features.
SHARMA2022116159¡A framework for visual question answering with the integration of scene-text using PHOCs and fisher vectors¡Computer vision= Dynamic pointer networks= PHOC= Fisher vector¡Text contained in an image gives useful information about that image. Consider a warning signboard with text “high voltage”; it indicates the hazard or risk involved in the image. Thus, this semantic textual information can be very useful for better understanding of images, which is not utilized by the existing visual question answering (VQA) models. However, the presence of this textual information in images can strongly guide the VQA task. This work deal with the task of visual question answering by exploiting these textual cues together with the visual content to boost the accuracy of VQA models. In the work, a novel VQA model is proposed based on the PHOC and fisher vector based representation. Based on the PHOCs of the scene-text, we have constructed a powerful descriptor by using a Fisher Vectors. Also, the proposed model uses transformer model together with dynamic pointer networks for answer decoding process. Thus, the proposed model uses a sequence of decoding steps for answer generation instead of just assuming answer prediction as a classification problem as considered by previous works. We have shown the qualitative and quantitative results on three popular datasets: VQA 2.0, TextVQA and ST-VQA. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed model over the existing models.
SILVA2022116162¡Modeling supply-chain networks with firm-to-firm wire transfers¡Networks= Firm trade networks= Wire transfers¡We study a novel economic network (supply chain) comprised of wire transfers (electronic payment transactions) among the universe of firms in Brazil (6.2 million firms). We construct a directed and weighted network in which vertices represent cities and edges connote pairwise economic dependence between cities. Cities (vertices) represent the collection of all firms in that location, and links denote intercity wire transfers. We find a high degree of economic integration among cities in the trade network, consistent with the high degree of specialization across Brazilian cities. We identify cities with a dominant role as customers and suppliers to the entire supply chain using centrality network measures. The supply-chain network has a disassortative mixing pattern, which is explained by the heterogeneity in the size of Brazilian municipalities. We find that the supply-chain network becomes more disassortative during adverse times, such as the Brazilian recession in 2014 and the global financial crisis. We use entrepreneurship data and show that one potential driver of this change is the death of small firms, leading to a greater concentration of economic flows in larger centers. Our results suggest that adverse events significantly impact the supply-chain network with meaningful and heterogeneous economic consequences across municipalities. We run econometric exercises and find that courts’ efficiency plays a dual role. From the customer perspective, it may reduce contractual frictions and increase economic transactions between cities. From the supplier perspective, cities that are central suppliers to the supply chain may use courts’ inefficiency as a lawsuit barrier from their customers.
SOTO2022116169¡Two novel branch and bound algorithms for the vertex bisection problem¡Vertex bisection problem= B&B= Upper bound= Lower bound¡In this paper, we address the exact solution of the vertex bisection problem (VBP). We propose two novel B&B algorithms to solve VBP, which include new upper and lower bound constructive heuristics, and an efficient strategy to explore the combinatorial search space. The computational results show that the proposed algorithms clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art B&B algorithm in quality and efficiency. The two proposed B&B versions differ in the exploration strategy and the storage of the search tree. Also, we provide four new solutions, previously unknown. We consider that the main contributions of this work can be adapted to solve combinatorial problems in other related domains.
WANG2022116207¡A fake review identification framework considering the suspicion degree of reviews with time burst characteristics¡Fake review= Time series= Machine learning= Data and text mining¡With the rapid development of e-commerce, online reviews have played an increasingly important role in consumers' shopping intentions and behaviors. Therefore, how to effectively identify fake reviews has become one of the important issues that need to be resolved. Since the existing methods do not fully consider the time burst characteristics of reviews, this paper proposes a suspicion degree determining method based on the three-dimensional time series. Besides, combining the suspicion degree feature, review text features, and reviewer's behavior features together, this paper proposes a more comprehensive fake review identification framework. The yelp and amazon public data sets are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the most advanced methods.
